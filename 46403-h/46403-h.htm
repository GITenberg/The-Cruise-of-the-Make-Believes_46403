<h2>CHAPTER I<br />

<small>THE PRINCESS NEXT DOOR</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>THE thin young man with the glossy hat got out
of the cab at the end of the street, and looked
somewhat distrustfully down that street; glanced
with equal distrust at the cabman. A man lounging
against the corner public-house, as though to keep
that British institution from falling, and leaving
him without refreshment, got away from it, and inserted
himself between the driver and the fare, ready
to give information or advice to both, on the strength
of being a local resident.</p>

<p>"Are you quite sure that this is Arcadia Street?"
asked the young man in the glossy hat. He had
a thin, meagre, precise sort of voice&mdash;delicate and
mincing.</p>

<p>"Carn't yer see it wrote up?" demanded the
driver, pointing with his whip to the blank wall that
formed one side of the street. "Wotjer think I
should want to drop yer in the wrong place for?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
He was a cross driver, for he had already been driving
about in the wilds of Islington in search of
Arcadia Street for a long time, and he was doubtful
whether or not that fact would be remembered in the
fare.</p>

<p>"Yus&mdash;this is Arcadia Street, guv'nor," said the
man from the public-house. "You take it from me;
I've bin 'ere, man an' boy, since before I could remember.
Wot part of it was you wantin', sir?"</p>

<p>But the young man had already given the cabman
a substantial fare, and had turned away. The man
from the public-house jogged along a little behind
him, eager to be of service for a consideration to a
man to whom a shilling or two seemed to mean nothing
at all; a few bedraggled staring children had
sprung up, as if by magic, and were also lending
assistance, by the simple expedient of walking backwards
in front of the stranger, and stumbling over
each other, and allowing him to stumble over them.
And still the young man said nothing, but only
glanced anxiously at the houses.</p>

<p>He did not fit Arcadia Street at all. For he was
particularly well dressed, with a neatness that made
one fear almost to brush against him; while Arcadia
Street, Islington, is not a place given to careful
dressing, or even to neatness. Moreover, silk hats
are not generally seen there, save on a Monday morning,
when a gentleman of sad countenance goes
round with a small book and a pencil, in the somewhat
cheerless endeavour to collect rents; and his silk hat
is one that has seen better days. So that it is small
wonder that the young man was regarded with awe
and surprise, not only by the straggling children,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
but also by several women who peered at him from
behind doubtful-looking blinds and curtains.</p>

<p>Still appearing utterly oblivious of the questions
showered upon him by the now frantic man who had
constituted himself as guide, the young man had got
midway up the street, and was still searching with his
eyes the windows of the houses. If you know Arcadia
Street at all, you will understand that in order to
search the windows he had but to keep his head turned
in one direction; for the habitable part of the street
lies only on the left-hand side, the other being formed
by a high blank wall, shutting in what is locally
known as "The Works." From behind this wall a
noise of hammering and of the clang of metal floats
sometimes to the ears of Arcadia Street, and teaches
them that there is business going on, although they
cannot see it.</p>

<p>Now, just as the young man had reached the middle
of the street, and the loafer who had accompanied
him was almost giving up in despair, the eyes of the
young man looked into the eyes of a young girl on
the other side of a sheet of glass. The sheet of glass
represented one part of one window of a house, and
at the moment the young man turned his gaze in that
direction, she was setting up against the glass a card
which bore the modest inscription&mdash;"Board and
Residence." And she was so unlike Arcadia Street
generally that the young man stopped, and made a
faltering movement with one arm, as though he
would have raised his hat, and looked at her helplessly.
Instantly, something to his relief, she raised
the window, careless of what became of the card, and
looked out at him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps, sir, you might be looking for&mdash;"
So she began; and then faltered and stopped.</p>

<p>"You're very good," he responded, in his precise
voice. "Name of Byfield&mdash;Mr. Gilbert Byfield.
Does he live here?"</p>

<p>"Next door, sir," she said, as she slowly lowered
the window. And it seemed to the young man that
for a moment, although she was evidently interested
in him, a shadow of disappointment crossed her face.</p>

<p>He raised his hat, disclosing for a moment a very
neatly arranged head of fair hair, parted accurately
in the middle; and then rang the bell at the adjoining
house. By this time his guide, seeing that he was
about to escape, began rapidly to urge his claims,
the while the young man took not the faintest notice
of him, but kept his eyes fixed on the door he expected
to see open every moment.</p>

<p>"Didn't I tell yer w'ere it was, guv'nor?" demanded
the man. "Where'd you 'ave bin, if it 'adn't
bin for me; you might 'ave lorst yerself a dozen
times. I says to meself, w'en I sees yer gettin' out
of the cab&mdash;I says to meself&mdash;''E's a gent&mdash;that's
wot 'e is&mdash;'e's one of the tip-tops. You look arter
'im,' I says, 'an' see if 'e don't do the 'andsome by
yer.' .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Well&mdash;of all the ugly smug-faced
dressed-up&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>For the door had opened, and the young man of
the glossy hat had been swallowed up inside. Mr.
Byfield was at home. The loafer looked the house
up and down aggressively, and seemed on the point
of expressing his opinion concerning it and its inhabitants
publicly; deemed that a waste of breath apparently;
and drifted away, to take up his old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
position at the corner of the street. The children,
coming reluctantly to the understanding that there
was not likely to be a fight, or even an altercation,
drifted away also.</p>

<p>Above the curtain of the window of the next house
the plaintive pretty face of the girl appeared again
for a moment, and then was withdrawn. So far as
the street was concerned, the incident was closed, and
the mystery of the young man's appearance had been
transferred to the house itself. For his inquiry for
Mr. Byfield had led to his being directed up certain
shabby stairs, until he came to a door; he had just
raised his knuckles delicately to knock upon it, when
it was flung open, and the man he had come to see
stood before him.</p>

<p>It would be difficult indeed to imagine a greater
contrast between any two men than that which existed
between the visitor and the visited. For Gilbert
Byfield was big and hearty&mdash;not in any sense of
mere fleshiness, but rather because there was a largeness
about his actions and his gestures&mdash;a certain
impulsive eagerness in all he did, as though each day
was all too short for what he wanted to crowd into it.
He was in his shirt-sleeves (for it seems always to
be hot and stuffy in Arcadia Street, Islington) and a
pipe was in his mouth. He grinned amiably, but a
little sheepishly, at his visitor; suddenly leaned forward,
and caught the immaculate one by the hand
and drew him into the room.</p>

<p>"Of all wonders," he ejaculated&mdash;"how did you
get here?"</p>

<p>The thin young man, who had removed his hat,
was glancing round the dingy walls of the room,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
and at the table in the centre that was strewn with
books and papers. "My dear Byfield," he said, in
his thin voice, "I might almost repeat that question
to you. I am amazed, Byfield; I am pained and outraged.
Why are you hiding in this place?"</p>

<p>Gilbert Byfield threw himself into his chair, and
laughed. "No question of hiding," he said. "I
came here for a change of air&mdash;change of scene&mdash;change
of surroundings. I'm studying."</p>

<p>"What for?" demanded the visitor.</p>

<p>Byfield leant forward over the table, and looked
at his friend half contemptuously, half whimsically.
"The world I've left behind me," he said, "was peopled
by quite a lot of men of the type of a certain
Jordan Tant&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thank you," said the other, with a nod.</p>

<p>"All very worthy and delightful people, but unfortunately
all saying the same thing&mdash;day after
day&mdash;year in and year out. They were always
dressed in the same fashion, and they always had a
certain considerable amount of respectable money in
the pockets of their respectable clothes; and they
always got up at exactly the same hour every morning,
and they lived their dear little Tant-like lives,
until the time came for them to be turned, in due
course, into little Tant-like corpses, and presumably
after that into nice little Tant-like angels. And I
got tired of them, and finally gave them up. Now,"
he added, throwing himself back in his chair, and
laughing good-humouredly, "you know all about
it."</p>

<p>Mr. Jordan Tant had seated himself on a chair
opposite his friend, and had been listening attentively.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
He now hitched his trousers up carefully
over his knees, displaying rather neat ankles, and
began to speak in an argumentative fashion, with
his neat head a little on one side. "You're not complimentary,
Byfield," he said; "but then you never
were. I should not have found you, but for the fact
that some one mentioned to me that you were living
in a place called Arcadia Street, Islington; and as
I wondered a little what reason you could possibly
have for leaving your own natural surroundings, I
decided to look you up. As for the Tant-like people
of whom you speak so scornfully, I would remind
you that they belong properly to that sphere to
which you also belong, when you are not in your
present revolutionary spirit. You are forgetting
what I have endeavoured often to remind you about;
you are forgetting the dividing line which must be
kept between the classes and the masses. The world
knows you as Mr. Gilbert Byfield&mdash;with any amount
of money, and any amount of property; you are
masquerading as a very ordinary person, in a very
ordinary and commonplace neighbourhood. Now
what, for instance, do you pay for these rooms?"
He glanced round as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Ten shillings a week&mdash;which of course includes
the use of the furniture," said Gilbert, smiling.
"Meals extra."</p>

<p>"Horrible!" exclaimed his friend. "Where is
the comfortable set of chambers in the West End;
where is your place in the country&mdash;your yacht&mdash;everything
of that kind? And what in the name of
fortune are you doing it for?"</p>

<p>"I've already told you," responded the other, good-humouredly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
"I wanted to see what life really was,
when you didn't have someone near at hand to feed
you, and clothe you, and make much of you; I
wanted to look at a world where banking accounts
and dividends were unknown, and stocks and shares
something not to be considered. I wanted to see
what people were like who had to scramble for a
living&mdash;to scramble, in fact, for the crumbs that fall
from tables such as mine. I had read in books of
people who had a difficulty in making both ends meet&mdash;and
quite nice people at that; I had dreamed of
a world outside my own very ordinary one, where
romance was to be found&mdash;and beauty&mdash;and love
and tenderness. I was sick to death of the high
voices and the gracious airs and the raised eyebrows
of most of the women I knew&mdash;the time-killers, with
nothing in the world to occupy them; I wanted to
take off my coat, and get back to what I know my
grandfather, at least, was in his time: a real hard-working
citizen. A better man than ever I shall be,
Jordan; a clear-headed, clear-hearted fellow, with
no nonsense about him. He made a fortune&mdash;and
my father trebled it; it has been my sacred mission
to spend it. There"&mdash;he got to his feet, and
stretched his arms above his head, and laughed&mdash;"I've
done preaching; and you shall tell me all the
news from the great world out of which I have
dropped."</p>

<p>"What news can I have to give you?" demanded
Mr. Tant, with an almost aggressive glance at his
friend. "Oh, I know what you're going to say,"
he added rapidly as he raised his hand&mdash;"that that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
is the best comment on what you have said. But, at
all events, we live respectably&mdash;not in hovels."</p>

<p>"Respectable is the word," said Gilbert, with
something of a sigh. "And yet I'm sure that you
really have news&mdash;of a sort. Come&mdash;a bargain
with you: you shall give me your news, bit by bit,
and item by item; and I'll see if I can match it from
my experience here."</p>

<p>"Well, in the first place," said Mr. Jordan Tant,
shifting uneasily on his chair, and finally drawing up
his legs until his heels rested on the front wooden
rail of it&mdash;"in the first place, Miss Enid wonders
what has become of you, and is naturally somewhat
troubled about you." He said it sulkily, with the
air of one to whom the delivery of the message was
a disagreeable task.</p>

<p>"Exactly. And the fair Enid is in that drawing-room
which is like a hot-house, and is yawning the
hours away, and glancing occasionally at the clock,
to determine how long it is since she had lunch, and
how best she shall get through the time before tea
is announced. To match that, my item of news is of
a certain little lady who has a habit of tucking up
her sleeves, the better to get through hours that are
all too short for the work that must fill them, who
is afraid to glance at a clock, for fear it should tell
her how time is flying; and who never by any chance
had a best frock yet that wasn't almost too shabby
to wear before it was called best at all. Go on."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;so that's the secret, is it?" exclaimed Mr.
Tant, nodding his head like a smooth-plumaged
young bird. "There's a woman in Arcadia Street&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>"Beware how you speak of her lightly," said
Gilbert. "In Arcadia Street are many women; they
hang out of the windows, and they scream at their
children, and they tell their husbands exactly what
their opinion is concerning the characters of those
husbands whenever the unfortunate men are not at
work. But&mdash;mark the difference, my Tant!&mdash;there
is but one woman worthy of the name, and
I have found her. She lives next door."</p>

<p>"Then I've seen her," replied Jordan Tant.
"Rather pretty, perhaps&mdash;but pale and shabby."</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;she hadn't got her best frock on," said
Gilbert. "You have to wait for Sundays to see the
best frock; and then you have to pretend that it
isn't really an old frock pretending to be best.
Where did you see her?"</p>

<p>"Sticking a card in the window&mdash;something
about apartments or&mdash;lodgings," said Mr. Tant.
"I think she thought there was some chance that I
might be insane enough to want to live in Arcadia
Street."</p>

<p>"Poor little girl!" said Gilbert softly, as he
seated himself on the edge of the table, and thrust
some of his papers out of the way. "She dreams
about lodgers&mdash;and hopes for the sort that pay.
I believe she gets up in the morning, dreadfully
afraid that those who owe her money have run away
in the night; I believe she goes to bed at night,
wondering if by any possibility she can squeeze another
bedstead in somewhere to accommodate a fresh
one. She would like to go out into the highways and
byways, and gather in all possible lodgers, and drive
them before her to the house; and keep 'em there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
for ever. You've only got to say 'Lodgers!' to
that girl, and her eyes brighten at once."</p>

<p>"What an extraordinary person!" exclaimed Mr.
Jordan Tant, opening his eyes very wide, and staring
up at the other man. "What's she do it for?"</p>

<p>"For a living, Tant&mdash;for a sordid horrible
grinding sweating living." Gilbert got up in his
excitement, and began to bang one fist into the palm
of his other hand close to the face of Mr. Jordan
Tant. "You talk of life&mdash;and respectability&mdash;and
what not; I tell you I've seen more life in a
week in Arcadia Street than ever I saw in years
before. Look out into the streets; you'll see a
dozen sights that shock you&mdash;you'll see a dozen
things that are unlovely. And yet I tell you that
I have stepped in this place straight into the heart
of Fairyland&mdash;and that I dream dreams, and see
visions. And all on account of a pale-faced shabby
girl, who lives next door, and lies in wait behind the
parlour window to catch the lodgers who never pay
her when they come!"</p>

<p>"Why don't you live there yourself?" demanded
Mr. Tant. "You'd pay her well enough."</p>

<p>Gilbert shook his head a little sadly. "That
wouldn't do at all," he said, "because I should take
all the romance out of the thing. Besides, in Arcadia
Street you mustn't pay more than a certain
amount, or you bring down suspicion upon yourself.
No&mdash;my method is a more subtle one: I am the
mysterious man who lives next door&mdash;(which is
quite a great way off in Arcadia Street, I can assure
you)&mdash;and I appear to her only with a sort of
halo of romance about me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>"You're in love with her, I suppose?" suggested
Mr. Tant.</p>

<p>"That's crude&mdash;and untrue," said Gilbert.
"That's the only thing you sort of people seem to
think about: you look at a girl, and instantly you're
in love with her. Doesn't it occur to you that it
may be possible that I, from the distance of my
thirty-five years, may look at this child of seventeen&mdash;or
perhaps even less&mdash;and feel sorry for her,
and desirous of helping her. Bah!&mdash;what do you
know of romance?"</p>

<p>"I know this about it," said Mr. Tant, a little
sullenly, "that if I go back to Miss Enid, and tell
her that you take a deep interest in a very pretty
girl of seventeen, who lives next door to you in a
slum, and with whom you occasionally visit Fairyland,
it is more than possible that the lady to whom
you are supposed to be engaged&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am not engaged to her," exclaimed Gilbert,
almost savagely.</p>

<p>"May have something to say regarding romance
on her own account. I state facts." Thus Mr.
Jordan Tant, very virtuously, and with his head
nodding in a sideways fashion at his friend.</p>

<p>"You pervert them, you mean," exclaimed Gilbert.
"Besides, if you're so deeply interested in
Miss Enid Ewart-Crane, this will be a splendid
opportunity for you to set yourself right with her,
to my everlasting damage."</p>

<p>"You know perfectly well that she'd never look
at me," said Mr. Tant. "She's a glorious creature&mdash;a
wonderful woman, and in your own sphere of
life; I can't see why you neglect her as you do."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have been told ever since I was a mere boy
that at some future date I should marry Enid&mdash;if
I were good. It's just like a small boy being offered
anything&mdash;if he is good; he begins to loathe the
idea of it at once. Enid is all that you say&mdash;and
I like her very much; but if I've got to marry her
I'll choose my own time for it. At present I'm in
Fairyland&mdash;and I mean to stop there."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by Fairyland?" asked Mr.
Tant testily.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't understand if I told you," replied
Gilbert. Then he added quickly, and with contrition&mdash;"There&mdash;there&mdash;my
dear fellow, I
didn't mean to hurt your feelings; you're not really
a bad sort, if you'd come out of your shell sometimes,
and let the real wind of the real earth ruffle
your hair a bit. I must talk to someone&mdash;and I'm
not sorry to find you here to-day; only you mustn't
tell anyone outside."</p>

<p>"Of course not," almost snapped Mr. Tant.</p>

<p>"I came here in the first place, Tant," began
Gilbert, seating himself again on the table, "with
the expectation of finding that I had got among
commonplace people&mdash;and not nice commonplace
people at that. Then I saw this girl&mdash;this mere
child, that even a hard world and a hard and sordid
life had not changed, struggling on day by day to
make a living&mdash;not for herself, or for any selfish
reason&mdash;but to keep those who should by rights
have kept her. And I saw her, above all things,
doing something else, and doing it rather splendidly."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't understand you. What else was she
doing?" asked Jordan Tant.</p>

<p>It was growing dark in Arcadia Street, and the
lamps were being lighted. With the dying of the
day a sort of hush had fallen upon the place; the
sounds outside were subdued, as though even Arcadia
Street might be inclined for rest. Gilbert had walked
across to the window, and stood there, looking out;
his face was turned from his friend.</p>

<p>"This child to whom life was a mean and sordid
struggle had taught herself a lesson&mdash;had shown
herself how best to live another life. You'll think it
mean and commonplace, perhaps; but this little
drudge&mdash;child alike in years and in thoughts&mdash;had
learnt how to make-believe to perfection; knew
how to gild the commonplace bricks and mortar of
Arcadia Street so that the mean houses became palaces&mdash;the
mean back gardens places of beauty,
wherein one might stroll beneath the light of the
moon, and listen even unto nightingales. Think of
it, Tant; this child who had never known anything
but the mean streets of a great city had yet learnt
how to dream, and almost how to make her dreams
come true. I tell you, man, you've only got to look
into her eyes to understand that there is in her that
brave spirit that defies poverty and disaster&mdash;that
brave spirit that aims straight for the skies."</p>

<p>Mr. Jordan Tant sat still for a moment or two
without speaking. He was used by this time to this
impulsive friend, who was for ever doing unconventional
things; and now, with this new unconventional
thing to face, he had no words either of reproof
or admonition. Very slowly he lifted first one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
foot and then the other from the wooden rail of the
chair, and stood up; picked up his hat, and brushed
it carefully on his sleeve.</p>

<p>"I've nothing to say to you," he said at last. "I
expect, if the truth were known, you'd find that the
lady who dwells in Fairyland in her spare moments
has a scheming mind, and a money-grubbing soul;
you'd find she thought more of the price of chops
than she does of all the romances that ever were
invented for fools to read. What am I to tell Miss
Enid?"</p>

<p>Gilbert Byfield laughed good-humouredly. "Tell
her," he said, "that I shall come and see her very
soon. But you need not, of course, say anything
about&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"About the Princess next door? I suppose not."
Mr. Jordan Tant walked to the door of the room,
and laid his hand upon the handle. "It'll be all right
for you&mdash;and you'll give up this madness, just as
you have given up many, many others. But what
about the&mdash;the Princess?"</p>

<p>"You don't understand in the least," said Gilbert,
a little hastily. "She thinks no more of me than she
might think of anybody who was good to her&mdash;kind
to her."</p>

<p>"But so very few people have been good or kind
to her, you see," Mr. Tant reminded him, as he
opened the door.</p>

<p>"I'll come with you, and find a cab for you; you
might get lost," said Gilbert. "And pray get all
those silly notions out of your head; if you knew
this child as well as I do, you'd look at the matter in
a different light. At the same time, as people are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
so apt to misunderstand even our best motives, perhaps
you'd better not say anything to Enid&mdash;or
to her mother. If there's any explaining to be done,
I can do it when I come to see them."</p>

<p>He found the cab for his friend, and saw him
drive away. Walking back slowly into Arcadia
Street, he determined that he would if possible see
that little Princess next door that very evening&mdash;if
only to assure himself that she was the child he
knew her to be, and he her big friend&mdash;years and
years older and wiser.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />
<small>THE KING OF A LEAN KINGDOM</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>ARCADIA STREET is noted&mdash;locally, at least&mdash;for
its "gardens." By this term I would
not have you understand that hidden away in that
corner of Islington are bowers of beauty, or that
you may stroll at eventide under the drooping
branches of trees, what time the soft scents of flowers
are wafted to your nostrils. Rather let it be
said that attached to each dingy house is a dingy
plot of ground that is only a "garden" by courtesy&mdash;a
place where the primeval instincts of man
have from time to time urged him to dig in the earth,
for the sole reason that it is earth, and in the mad
hope to raise from it something that no other London
garden has yet accomplished. The moon that
looks down on each slip of ground at night knows
differently; she has seen the thing being done for
generation after generation, and finally given up in
despair. Also the cats look on tolerantly, because
they too know how it will end, and that the victory
will be with them easily in the long run.</p>

<p>You may look into many such gardens, and may
see for yourselves how bravely they began&mdash;with
what high hopes. Here, for example, is what was
once intended to be a summer-house; and it has long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
since fallen into decay, and become a place where
the shabby things that are not wanted even in a
shabby house have been tossed from time to time,
and left to ruin. You will see creepers that started
well, and intended great things, and clung quite
bravely to walls; until the London atmosphere and
neglect and one thing and another put an end to
them. And you may see rows and rows of pots,
wherein nothing grows nor ever will grow, and
wherein the very earth that fills them is of a consistency
known nowhere else. Here and there, too,
a bit of trellis-work had been put up and painted;
in Arcadia gardens it is generally found to be an
easy hanging place for cloths and doubtful-looking
garments.</p>

<p>In the gardens of Arcadia Street was one exception.
That exception was the house, behind the front
window of which, the wistful face of a girl had looked
out at Mr. Jordan Tant&mdash;that girl about whom he
had heard so much from his friend Gilbert Byfield.
The house itself, poor and shabby though it was,
was neat and scrupulously clean; but the real triumph
of it lay in the garden. Not, perhaps, in the
artistic sense, but rather that it was a garden of
surprises&mdash;a place where it was impossible to say
what you might meet next, if you wandered carefully
through its circumscribed length, and took it
seriously.</p>

<p>Yet to anyone to whom the mere name of garden
means so much, what a pitiful place! For there was
nothing really garden-like about it; it was a place
of rags and patches and pretences. The few pitiful
plants that struggled out of the black-looking earth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
here and there seemed to do so not because they liked
it, but because they had a desperate desire to show
what they could do, even against adverse fate, when
they were put to it. Half a dozen things that could
not have been named even by the most careful student
in botany stood in pots under the kitchen window;
and in front of these, spread out on the earth
itself, was an old and very ragged carpet&mdash;a trap
to the unwary, because of the many holes it contained
and the uneven surface it presented on the
uneven ground.</p>

<p>With the idea of hiding the carpet as much as
possible, and at the same time of giving an air of
luxury to the place, an ancient staggering table on
three legs had been placed in the centre of it; and
on either side of this table a chair, long since set
aside as being too deplorable even for use in that
house. It was a very mockery of a table, and the
chairs were in a dreadful conspiracy with it to let
down any unwary mortal who should attempt to
sit upon them in their old age, unless he treated
them with due caution and respect.</p>

<p>Nor was this all; the garden held other treasures.
Another ancient strip of carpet, as ragged
as its fellow, had been hung against a wall to form
a species of background to a crazy box that stood
against that wall. Not that you would ever have
called it a box; it had a dingy rug upon it, and
that dingy rug made it, of course, a species of settle
or ottoman&mdash;an easy lounging place on summer
nights. You had to sit down carefully upon it,
because it had a defective board, which gave way
unexpectedly and might let you through; but with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
care that was a fault that might not be noticed.
For the rest, the place contained a bulky old plaster
flower-pot, with some seedy-looking moss growing
in it, and with great cracks at the further side
from the house.</p>

<p>The kindly darkness was hiding the tawdriness
of the place when a little door at the end of the
garden opened, and a little man came in. A man
shabby like all the place; with an old frock-coat
much too large for him hanging in scarecrow fashion
from his thin shoulders, with trousers much too
long for him lapping over carpet slippers frayed
and worn, and with an old velvet smoking-cap, with
three strands of frayed silk to represent a tassel,
stuck on one side of his head. A melancholy-looking
little man, with a certain fierce sullenness upon
him, as though he quarrelled perpetually with the
world at large. He slammed the gate, and advanced
into that sorry garden; made as if to kick the
unwieldy cracked flower-pot, but thought better of
it; and went shambling towards the table set upon
the ragged carpet.</p>

<p>The fact that he caught his foot in a hole in the
carpet, and almost precipitated himself over the
table, did not improve his temper. He glared savagely
about him, and gave his head a fierce rub
with his cap before seating himself gingerly on one
of the chairs. Having done so, he pulled his frock-coat
closer about him, and shivered in the warm and
stifling air.</p>

<p>"It's a conspiracy&mdash;that's what it is!" exclaimed
the little man. "It's an infernal conspiracy
against me from first to last!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>The shadows were lengthening in the garden,
and the little man was rather a pathetic figure as
he sat there, solemnly shaking his head and muttering
to himself. Someone who had come to the back
door of the house, and looked out upon him, hesitated
for a moment, and then stepped quickly out
towards him. A young girl with a bright, eager,
thin face; the girl who had looked through the
window at Mr. Jordan Tant. She came quickly
towards the man, and dropped her arm round his
shoulders, and whispered to him.</p>

<p>"Father&mdash;you're home quite early," she said.
"Will you have your coffee out here?"</p>

<p>He shook himself peevishly away from her embrace.
"Coffee?" he exclaimed. "Who the devil
wants coffee, Bessie? A man wants something
stronger than coffee. Besides&mdash;what's the good of
making a fuss about my being home as early as
this? You don't suppose I should have come home
but for a very good reason&mdash;do you?"</p>

<p>The girl winced a little, and drew away from him.
"I thought perhaps for once you were glad to
come home, father," she said timidly. "And you
know I always like to think of us sitting out in the
garden&mdash;under the stars&mdash;and drinking our coffee.
The best people do that every night of their
lives&mdash;after dinner."</p>

<p>"After dinner!" he reminded her, raising a finger,
and shaking it at her. "That makes all the
difference in the world; I dare say anyone might
drink the stuff after a good dinner&mdash;just to oblige
a friend. But what is anyone to do&mdash;in what condition
of mind do you imagine a man to be&mdash;when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
his dinner has been a thing not of the stalled ox
order&mdash;but of herbs? Besides&mdash;I'm upset&mdash;annoyed."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, father," said the girl softly. She
tiptoed into the house, and softly called to someone
within; came out again, and sat down at the further
side of the table, folding her hands upon it,
and looking at the shabby figure of the man on the
other side of it.</p>

<p>"What has gone wrong, dear?" she whispered;
and at the question he suddenly turned upon her,
and opened the very floodgates of his wrath and
misery.</p>

<p>"Turned out&mdash;ejected&mdash;thrust to the door
with gibes and laughter!" he exclaimed. "For
how many years have I not, in a sense, been the
very prop and stay of that place&mdash;its chief ornament&mdash;the
one being who in an impoverished and
sordid neighbourhood has shed upon it the light
of what I may term real intellect. I ask you, Bessie&mdash;for
how many years?"</p>

<p>"For more years than I can remember, father,"
whispered the girl, turning away her head.</p>

<p>"Exactly," he responded triumphantly. "It
has been to me not a mere house of refreshment&mdash;but
a club&mdash;a place in which, by virtue of long
usage, I had a species of proprietary right.
They'll find their mistake out, of course; they're
bound to do that in time. The Arcadia Arms without
me degenerates into a mere low public-house&mdash;a
pot-house; I had succeeded in raising the place.
I was a feature&mdash;almost an institution. And now
a vulgar creature&mdash;without a coat, mark you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Bessie!&mdash;points to the door, and says that I'm
not to be served again. Some talk of a score&mdash;of
a paltry sum that should have been paid long
since."</p>

<p>There was silence between them for a minute; it
seemed as if, in the gathering darkness, the petty
record of the years was being told over between
them&mdash;so much to this account, and so much to
that. The man in the shabby frock-coat seemed to
shrink and dwindle&mdash;to fall away from what he
would have appeared in her eyes, and to be the mean
thing he really was. When presently he went on
with his tale, it was as though he sought for excuses
for himself, and blamed her in so doing.</p>

<p>"That place was in a sense my last refuge; I
held a position there I hold nowhere else now.
When the cares of the world pressed upon me more
than usual, I was able to turn there; I had my seat
in a special corner&mdash;and I was respected. It was
known always and everywhere as 'Mr. Meggison's
place'; and only once in all the years has it been
usurped&mdash;and then the man was drunk. He was
very properly turned out at once, of course, and
made to understand the enormity of his offence.
And now&mdash;now, Bessie"&mdash;he turned to the girl,
and feebly smote the crazy table with his fist&mdash;"now
they tell me I am not to go there again&mdash;they
turn me out; I heard them laugh when the
door banged behind me. Oh&mdash;a bitter world&mdash;a
very bitter world, Bessie!"</p>

<p>In all that he said she knew that there was an
implied reproach for herself. For if Bessie Meggison
had but passed into his hands certain shillings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
this might never have happened; he might still
have held up his head at the Arcadia Arms&mdash;still
have filled his old seat in a corner&mdash;still have called
like a man for his glass to be filled. In that Bessie
had failed; and she knew it now.</p>

<p>"We have had a hard time, father," she said,
dropping a light hand on the fist with which he was
beating the table. "People don't come and take
the lodgings as they used to do; the things are
getting so poor and shabby that perhaps the more
fashionable young men don't like it. I try hard,
father&mdash;but every shilling seems to be so important."</p>

<p>"My dear Bessie, I am not aware that I have
blamed you," he said a little coldly, as he withdrew
his hand and turned away his head. "Time was
when Fortune smiled upon me, and I was able to do
work that brought in money; that time is long
since past. In a fashion, I may be said to have
retired; I am no longer actively engaged in commercial
pursuits."</p>

<p>"No, father&mdash;of course not," responded the
girl cheerfully.</p>

<p>"And you have often assured me that you are
glad&mdash;and proud&mdash;glad and proud to be able
to assist my declining years. It is not much that
I want: I saunter out in the sun in the morning,
and go down to my&mdash;my club&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The Arcadia Arms, father," she said gently.</p>

<p>"I prefer to call it my club," he said, a little
testily. "There I nod to an acquaintance or two&mdash;and
I have my modest glass, and perhaps smoke
a pipe, or even a mild cigar. In the afternoon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
a stroll and perhaps another modest glass; in the
evening a few more people gather there, and we are
almost convivial. That's my programme; that's
my day. For the rest, as you're aware, I occupy
the cheapest bed in the house&mdash;and I don't eat
much. Therefore I do urge," he concluded fretfully,
"that it is a shame that a man should be
deprived of the little thing that gives him so much
pleasure. I have been wounded to-night&mdash;sorely
hurt and wounded, Bessie."</p>

<p>"The coffee will be here directly, father," said
the girl.</p>

<p>"Coffee&mdash;served in cracked cups by a dingy
maid&mdash;in a back-yard," he cried viciously.
"There's nothing soothing or helpful or restful
about coffee&mdash;and I'm too old to pretend that this
place is anything but the back-yard it really is."</p>

<p>"It's better than any other garden in Arcadia
Street," she said. "And at a time like this, when&mdash;when
you don't see things so distinctly&mdash;it
looks quite good. If you shut your eyes the least
little bit, so that you can only just see out of them,
you seem to be looking down long spaces&mdash;ever so
far; and you can sit there under the wall, and think
you're anywhere&mdash;anywhere in the world except
in Arcadia Street."</p>

<p>"I have shut my eyes to a great many things far
too long, Bessie," he exclaimed fiercely. "I have
been inclined to forget at times who I really am,
and the position I should have occupied. I let my
children do as they like with me. Where, for instance,
is your brother to-night?"</p>

<p>"Aubrey always goes out in the evening," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
the girl quickly. "He likes his freedom, you know,
father dear."</p>

<p>"I know his freedom," said the man; "the freedom
of every low billiard saloon in the neighbourhood.
No intellect about him, mind you; no discussing
of matters of moment concerning the neighbourhood,
and even the nation, with Aubrey. Oh
dear, no; the knocking about of billiard balls is
more in his line. Aubrey will never cut a figure
in any resort of gentlemen. How much, for instance,
did your precious brother receive out of the
funds of the house&mdash;my house, mark you! How
much did he receive this day?"</p>

<p>"Aubrey had half a crown," said the girl, in
a mere whisper.</p>

<p>"Ye gods!" he exclaimed, starting to his feet.
"He flaunts it with half a crown all over London,
and his poor old father is shown the door in a pot-house,
because he can't pay his score. Bessie, I
could not have believed that you would sink so low!"</p>

<p>"Aubrey says that he must live," said the girl
wistfully. "And he likes always to feel that he is
a gentleman."</p>

<p>"Why doesn't he work?" exclaimed Mr. Meggison
savagely. "He is young and strong&mdash;why
should he borrow half-crowns; why doesn't he earn
'em instead? Things have come to a pretty pass
when I&mdash;Daniel Meggison&mdash;am refused necessary
refreshment in order that my son should flaunt it
on half-crowns. Bah!"</p>

<p>"Somebody seems to be talkin' about me," said
a voice from the doorway of the house. "What's
the row?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>The youth who sauntered out, and stood with his
hands in his pockets, looking from one to the other,
was not of an inviting type. Shiftless son of a
shiftless father, he lacked even that father's poor
dignity, and failed to carry himself so well as the
older man. He stooped at the shoulders, and his
mean and narrow face was thrust forward, and
bore an expression of knowingness, as though he
asserted that there was precious little in this world
you could teach him. A small billycock hat was
thrust on the back of his head, and from between
his lips drooped a cigarette; it was his proud boast
that he was never to be seen without the latter.</p>

<p>"The row is this," exclaimed the old man, "that
I want to know when you are going to take your
proper position in the world&mdash;and do your proper
work?"</p>

<p>"Don't you worry about me, dad," replied the
son; "I shall be there all right when the work
comes along. Always provided, mind you," he added
as an afterthought, "always provided that the
work suits me, and is of a sort that a gentleman can
take up. No hole-and-corner jobs for me; I know
what I want, and I mean to get it."</p>

<p>"You have already obtained from your sister
here to-day a sum of money far in advance of your
needs or your deserts," said old Meggison, wagging
his head at him. "Pray what do you want with
half-crowns?"</p>

<p>"Father&mdash;you shall have all the money you
want as soon as I get any myself," pleaded the girl
in a low voice. "Surely there is no need for quarrelling."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am not quarrelling; my dignity does not
permit me to quarrel," said Daniel Meggison, shaking
his arm free of her touch. "But I trust that
I know what is due to me as that boy's father; I
hope I know my duty."</p>

<p>"Hope so, dad, I'm sure," said the youth, as he
turned away. "Can't see for the life of me what
you're upset about. You've had your bit at times;
you've been kept going, same as I have&mdash;haven't
you?"</p>

<p>"My 'bit,' as you term it, is what is justly due
to me as the head of this house," exclaimed the elder
man.</p>

<p>"I wasn't aware that you were the head of the
house," said the youth. "If it comes to that, Bess
is the only one that does anything for what I'm
pleased to call a rotten family. I'm not saying,
mind you, that she does what she might, or that she
looks up the lodgers for what's due with that business
instinct she should; I'm only sayin' that she
does what a mere girl can do tolerably well. More
than that, she knows that her brother, bein' a gentleman,
can't go about London with empty pockets."</p>

<p>"What about my pockets?" demanded Daniel
Meggison, plunging his hands into them. "Who
thinks of my wants&mdash;my simple ordinary little
wants? Who deems it necessary even to know that
I have that refreshment that is not denied to the
lowest of the beasts?"</p>

<p>"The lowest of the beasts drink water," said
Aubrey, with a chuckle. "And I never heard of
you doin' that."</p>

<p>While Bessie stood looking helplessly from one to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
the other, and while a savage retort rose to the lips
of old Meggison, the door leading from the house
was opened, and a little servant-maid appeared. A
precise and prim little maid, who, having come from
some institution but a little time before, had felt
ever since that she was seeing life as she had never
hoped to see it; to her, indeed, the sorry garden
was a place of delight. She came out now almost
with eagerness, bringing that despised coffee on a
battered tray, and set it on the rickety table. And
at the same time announced some startling news.</p>

<p>"Oh, if you please, miss, a gent an' a lidy&mdash;name
o' Stocker&mdash;was waitin' in the passage&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hall!" thundered Mr. Daniel Meggison, so savagely
that the child almost knocked over the coffee-pot.
"How many times, Bessie, have I told you
that the domestics are to be instructed to give proper
names to the apartments in the house."</p>

<p>"You will be more careful in future, Amelia,
won't you?" suggested Bessie mildly. She turned
to her father, and spoke wistfully. "Perhaps Aunt
Julia and Uncle Ted had better come out here&mdash;in
the garden," she suggested.</p>

<p>"I will not see them," said Mr. Meggison. "I
am in no mood to see anyone; I should probably
insult my sister, to begin with. I dislike her as much
as I dislike her absurd prosperity."</p>

<p>"Don't ask me to meet 'em," said Aubrey, making
for the little gate in the wall. "Aunt Julia always
asks a chap what he's doin'&mdash;as though earnin'
your livin' was about the only blessed thing you'd
got to do in this world."</p>

<p>"I'd be glad if you'd stop and see them, Aubrey,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
pleaded Bessie; then to her father she added slyly&mdash;"It
will be so much more dignified if you stop
and meet them, father."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it will; I will put up with them on
your account, my child," said Mr. Meggison. "Aubrey&mdash;I
command you to stay."</p>

<p>"Your commands don't affect me the least little
bit," said Aubrey coolly, shifting his cigarette to
the other corner of his mouth. "But on Bessie's
account I don't mind lettin' myself be seen. Amelia&mdash;trot
'em out!"</p>

<p>Bessie Meggison having some idea of how these
things should be done, from certain accounts she
had read, or from certain things she had heard,
immediately got behind the crazy table, the better
to preside over that pouring out of coffee. She
bravely shut her eyes to the fact that the cups did
not match, and that the saucers were either too large
or too small, or that the coffee-pot was a mere tin
affair, blackened all up one side from contact with
the fire. She waited in that proud position the coming
of the unexpected guests.</p>

<p>Mrs. Stocker came first, looking about her with
the high dignity of one who moves in a very different
sphere, and who has condescended for once, in a
spirit of Christian virtue, to step down among beings
less fortunate. She was a large lady, holding
herself very erect; the sort of person with whom
you could not under any circumstances have cracked
a jest. Life was a simple and a respectable thing
with her; a serious matter, that could but lead in
due course to a very proper and becomingly elaborate
funeral. Women had been known to do remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
things, and to get their names into books
and newspapers; not so Julia Stocker. "From the
moment Edward Stocker claimed my hand, I knew
exactly what was going to happen to me, and I
acted accordingly," was her invariable summary of
the course of her life. Incidentally it may be mentioned
that Mr. Edward Stocker had "a little property"
and that Mrs. Stocker looked after it. Which
is to say that Mr. Stocker was a mild good-tempered
little man, with a partiality for convivial good
company into which he rarely got.</p>

<p>The lady came out of the house now, looking about
her somewhat disdainfully. She took Bessie's outstretched
hand, and, still with her eyes searching
the bare and shabby yard, touched the girl's cheek
for a moment with lips that had no softness about
them; performed the same ceremony with her
brother Daniel; and stared at Aubrey Meggison.
"I have come, brother," she said, in a voice that was
in itself almost dirge-like, "to see how you are getting
on."</p>

<p>"Very kind of you&mdash;but I'm not getting on at
all," said Meggison, furtively rubbing the place
on his cheek where her lips had been with his
knuckles. "More than that, I don't expect to."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I should have said that <i>we</i> have come&mdash;Edward
and myself&mdash;to inquire about you; for
of course without Edward I never attempt to do
anything. In my opinion the woman should always
be dependent upon the man, and guided by him.
Consequently, if Edward tells me that he desires that
I should call and inquire about my relatives, I do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
so, however distasteful it may be to me personally.
Edward&mdash;where are you?"</p>

<p>Mr. Stocker came from the house at that moment,
holding his hat in his hand, and looking about him
as though he felt he was in some place of historic
interest. He saw Bessie's hand, and after looking
at it for a moment or two, as though not quite certain
what it was, or how it concerned him, decided
to grasp it; and having done so looked up at the
girl, and smiled in rather a pleased way. But he
dropped the hand guiltily on hearing his wife's
voice.</p>

<p>"Edward!&mdash;why are you loitering? Where are
you?"</p>

<p>"Here, my dear," said Mr. Stocker, coming round
the table, and still looking about him as though marvelling
at the place in which he found himself.
"Charming spot, this!"</p>

<p>"Charming fiddlesticks!" exclaimed Mrs. Stocker,
sitting carefully on a chair. "A mere back-yard&mdash;with
nothing in it but rags and rubbish and
draughts. Surely you people don't live out here?"
she asked, glaring round upon them.</p>

<p>"We like to come here in the evening, aunt; it's
very pleasant then," said Bessie. "Will you have
some coffee, Aunt Julia?"</p>

<p>"No, I will not have some coffee&mdash;especially in
the open air," said Mrs. Stocker. "Nor will your
uncle Edward have coffee," she added, noting a tendency
on the part of that gentleman to reach for
one of the cups; "it always disagrees with him.
Not, of course, that I would wish for a moment to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
interfere with your enjoyment, Edward&mdash;but I
think I know what is best for you."</p>

<p>Mr. Stocker sighed and turned away; found his
way up to that improvised seat against the wall;
and, with that luck that usually attends such men,
discovered the loose board and almost went through;
he was frantically readjusting his balance when
Daniel Meggison, as though by the merest chance,
strolled up to him and dropped a hand on his
shoulder, and smiled in a friendly way.</p>

<p>"Glad to see you, Ted&mdash;always glad to see you,"
he said, keeping a wary eye upon Mrs. Stocker the
while, and lowering his voice suddenly and dramatically.
"You don't happen to have change for
half a sovereign, I suppose?"</p>

<p>Mr. Stocker slipped his hand into his pocket, and
brought out a small gold coin. "I don't think I
have," he began in a whisper; and then discovered,
something to his amazement, that by a species of
conjuring trick the coin had disappeared from his
hand and was entering the pocket of Mr. Daniel
Meggison, who was beaming upon him.</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter&mdash;one coin's easier to remember,"
said Meggison. "You shall have it back&mdash;certainly
within a week. You're a man to know,
sir."</p>

<p>Mrs. Stocker was speaking in her loud and strident
tones. "I should not be doing that duty that
is imposed upon me by the mere fact of being a
woman and a Stocker, did I not speak my mind.
I come here, and I find you all drifting on in exactly
the same way that you have always done&mdash;in
a shabby and shiftless manner, that seems to belong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
to you and Arcadia Street. Don't interrupt me;
there is only one being on this earth that has a right
to interrupt me&mdash;and he dare not do it." She
glared round upon Mr. Stocker as she spoke.</p>

<p>"We are very happy, Aunt Julia," said Bessie,
who was delicately sipping some of the half-cold
stuff known to Amelia as coffee. "Father has been
a little unfortunate over the matter of finding employment."</p>

<p>"A misfortune that has dogged him nearly all
his life," snapped Mrs. Stocker. "In what direction
are you looking, brother?"</p>

<p>"In all directions, my dear Julia," said Meggison,
in a jubilant tone that sprang from the fact
that he had unexpected money in his pocket. "I
may be said to say to the world&mdash;'Give me work;
help me to discover work; give me some hard task,
with appropriate pay attached to it&mdash;and then see
what I'll do!' I appeal to Bessie: am I not for
ever condemning the state of the labour market?"</p>

<p>"I have heard you speak of it often, father,"
said the girl.</p>

<p>"And what, for example, is Aubrey doing?" demanded
Mrs. Stocker, turning suddenly on that
youth. "What are his prospects?"</p>

<p>"What he's doing at the present time is this,"
said the youth, opening the door at the end of the
garden&mdash;"he's goin' out. And the prospects, as
far as you're concerned, are that you won't see him
again this evenin'. I'm goin' to have a hundred up
at the Arcadia Arms. Good night!"</p>

<p>As he was swinging out of the door Mr. Daniel
Meggison seized his arm, and held him for a moment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
"How dare you address a relative in such
a fashion, sir!" he cried. "Above all, how dare
you suggest that you will waste money upon such a
pursuit. Your aunt is right; you should by this
time have decided what work you will seize upon in
the world. There are many maxims I might employ
in such a case as yours&mdash;but I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't trouble, if I was you," said Aubrey,
shaking himself free. "As I've said before, I'm
ready for anything in the way of work, if I can only
see it before me, and know what I've got to look
forward to. If it isn't there, don't blame me."</p>

<p>He went out of the door, slamming it behind him;
his father, in a sudden access of virtue, pulled open
the door, and called after him down the narrow
alley which ran at the back of the houses&mdash;"Understand,
I will not permit you to frequent any such
place as the Arcadia Arms&mdash;a mere ordinary pot-house&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>His voice died away, and he contented himself by
shaking a fist in the direction of the retreating
youth. He slammed the door, and turned again to
his sister.</p>

<p>"I think that I shall be compelled to go out myself,
Julia," he said, while his fingers lovingly caressed
that small gold coin in his pocket. "I must
really look in at my club."</p>

<p>"Club? I didn't know you had one," said the
lady, rising. "However, we won't detain you; so
soon as I know that Edward commands me to return
home I shall be quite willing to leave Arcadia Street."</p>

<p>Mr. Daniel Meggison took the hint at once, and
hurried into the house; a minute or two later he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
might have been observed shuffling down the street
in the direction of the Arcadia Arms, having exchanged
his smoking-cap for a grimy grey felt that
was stuck jauntily on the side of his head. Mrs.
Stocker, having brought Mr. Stocker to his feet by
the simple expedient of turning to look at him,
shook hands with Bessie, and gave that young lady
at parting a few words of much-needed advice.</p>

<p>"Call things by their right names, my child,"
she said sternly. "A garden's a garden&mdash;and a
yard's a yard; this is a yard, and an untidy one at
that. Don't pretend; when you haven't got enough
to eat, don't eke it out with coffee badly served that
nobody wants. Come out of your dreams, and wake
up to the realities of life. Don't forget, whenever
you feel inclined to think that you are any better
off than you really are, or have anything to be
grateful for, that you're a mere ordinary commonplace
girl&mdash;or woman, if you like it better&mdash;and
that your mission in life is to slave from morning
to night for people that don't care a button about
you. My advice to you is: clear away this rubbish,
and keep chickens or something of that sort. Good
night."</p>

<p>It is probable that Mr. Stocker would have said
something more cheering, but for the fact that at
the very moment he had grasped Bessie's hand Mrs.
Stocker looked back from the doorway, and called
to him; he departed hurriedly and obediently. The
girl looked at the sorry array of cups and saucers,
and then at the poor wilderness about her; all in
a moment it seemed poor and mean and childish.
She sank down on to that box that was covered by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
the dingy old rug, and covered her face with her
hands.</p>

<p>The shadows were falling all about her, and the
Princess next door, as Gilbert Byfield had called her,
was crying softly to herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER III<br />

<small>THE PRINCE JUMPS OVER THE WALL</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>JUST how long Bessie might have sat there in the
dusk of the garden it is impossible to say; an
interruption was to be provided. Almost the last
of her sobs had died away, and she was beginning
to realize that this kind of thing would not do at
all, if her small world was to be kept going, when the
door leading into the little alley was opened cautiously,
and a young man came in. A very presentable
young man, with an honest face inclined to
laughter, over which a look of relief was stealing
as he saw the girl sitting there. He closed the gate
quietly, and took a few steps towards her; paused
and coughed. Instantly she sprang to her feet, and
faced him.</p>

<p>"Good evening!" he said. "Did I startle you?"</p>

<p>"Very much; I did not know there was anyone
there. How long have you been here?" she asked
suspiciously.</p>

<p>"I came in this very moment," he assured her.
"You see, I'm obliged to come in that way, because
there might be somebody&mdash;somebody looking out
for me at the front. Very handy house in that respect."
He grinned cheerfully, and she laughed
for very sympathy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>"Haven't you any good news, Mr. Dorricott?"
she asked, forgetting her own troubles for a moment.</p>

<p>He shook his head. "I went down to the theatre,
just to let them know I was about, you know, and
almost with the hope that someone might fall ill&mdash;or
be run over&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't!" she whispered with a shiver.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Miss Meggison&mdash;but a fellow gets
absolutely murderous at times, when he thinks of
the people who stand in his way. Here am I, without
a shilling to bless myself with&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Everyone that I have ever known, and everyone
that I ever shall know, has been and will be in that
state," exclaimed Bessie with conviction. "I don't
believe in all the stories about people having more
money than they know what to do with; I simply
can't believe them. All the world is poor and struggling&mdash;and
everybody fights for money that they
never by any chance get. I know it!" she said with
deep dejection.</p>

<p>"Well, it isn't quite like that," he replied.
"There are fellows in the profession, for instance,
who are known to touch three figures a week, and
who simply live in motor-cars; it's a known fact.
Other poor devils like myself walk on with the crowd,
or get an understudy&mdash;or something of that kind."</p>

<p>"It must be nice to be an actor," said Bessie,
looking at him with awe.</p>

<p>"It is&mdash;when you <i>are</i> an actor," he replied solemnly.
He moved away a step or two restlessly, and
then came back to her. "I say, Miss Meggison&mdash;there's
something I'd like to say to you."</p>

<p>"Not about the bill!" she pleaded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>"About the bill&mdash;yes; and about something
else," he replied earnestly. "The bill worries me
horribly&mdash;and it worries me more in your case
than it would in the case of anyone else. I haven't
any money, and I've got a large appetite&mdash;which
I endeavour to suppress as much as is consistent with
keeping a figure fit to be seen behind the footlights.
Many and many a tasty dish, Miss Meggison, which
you may think I scorn, I pass by because I simply
feel that I have no right to touch it; it would not
be fair. I never come into your little dining-room
without seeing the figures of my bill in huge white
characters on the wall; I'm ashamed of myself."</p>

<p>"I wish you wouldn't speak of it," she urged.</p>

<p>"But I must speak of it; it haunts me," he exclaimed.
"I know that in time it will be all right;
I know that in time I shall be able to pay you in
full&mdash;and pay other people as well. More than
that, the time will come when you will be proud of
me&mdash;really proud of me."</p>

<p>"We're all proud of you now; I laugh still when
I think of that time when you gave me tickets for
the pantomime, and I saw you as the front part of
the donkey."</p>

<p>"Don't!" he said in a low tone. "I know I was
funny. Everyone said so&mdash;but I could get no real
expression into it; you can't when the only way in
which you can move your jaws is by a string. But
I shall do finer things than that. In the years to
come I shouldn't be a bit surprised if Arcadia Street
was the scene of a rather imposing little ceremony&mdash;on
my account."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ceremony?" She looked at him in a bewildered
fashion.</p>

<p>"Yes. They may in all probability affix a tablet
to the house, recording the fact that Harry Dorricott
once lived here; it's frequently done&mdash;there's
a society for it. They will probably refer to me
then as 'poor Harry Dorricott'&mdash;and will say
how much greater things I might have done had I
lived."</p>

<p>"Mr. Dorricott! You're not ill?"</p>

<p>"Oh dear, no; but I have a sort of feeling that
I shall die young&mdash;or at least comparatively young.
So very many of our best people have done that. I
beg you won't alarm yourself, Miss Meggison," he
added hastily&mdash;"because I'm quite all right at the
present moment; never felt better in my life. The
only thing that worries me is about you."</p>

<p>"About me?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;because you see I'm actually living on
you&mdash;and that's a shameful thing. Perhaps you
may wonder that I don't go away, and live on somebody
else&mdash;some fat and uninteresting old landlady,
for instance, who wouldn't matter so much."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't like you to do that, because she
mightn't be kind to you," said Bessie.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;that isn't the reason," he replied, coming
near to her, and looking into her eyes. "You have
been kind to me; there's never been anyone in all
the world that has done so much for me as you have&mdash;helped
me, and urged me on, and cheered me up.
That's why, although I owe you this money, I can't
go away; I'd rather be a slave to you than to anyone
else. You didn't understand that&mdash;did you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
dear?" he whispered, not daring even to take her
hands. "From the very first moment, when I saw
you looking out of the window into Arcadia Street,
my heart gave a sort of jump, and I knew exactly
what had happened to me. Bessie&mdash;it's because I
love you that I can't go away."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;it isn't that; it's only because you're
sorry for me, just as quite a lot of other people are
sorry for me," she said softly. "You mustn't think
that I don't understand, or that I'm ungrateful; I
shouldn't be telling the truth if I didn't say that
it's quite the nicest thing anyone has ever said to
me in all my life. But I don't love anyone&mdash;except
my father&mdash;and Aubrey; I don't think I've got
time to love anyone. So you mustn't speak about
it again, please; you must forget it. And you can
stay as long as you like&mdash;and the bill won't matter."</p>

<p>"But you'll give me some better comfort than
that, Bessie," urged the boy. "I shan't always be
poor; I shall make a great name for myself some
day, and then I shall be able to lift you out of all
this, and make you happy."</p>

<p>"I'm not sure that I want to be lifted out of it,"
she told him, smiling. "Good night&mdash;and forget
all about it. You're my friend always, I know&mdash;and
I want friends."</p>

<p>There in the dark garden, with perhaps an idea
in his mind not wholly theatrical, he lifted her hand
to his lips before he turned away; and she stood
there, looking after him, with that warm touch still
upon her fingers, and with her heart beating a little
more rapidly than usual.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>After all, it must be nice to be loved, she thought;
to be made much of, and shielded from the cold, and
from hunger and poverty; never to listen to anything
but gentle kindly words; never to have to
meet frowning tradesmen, or duns of any sort;
never to trudge through the streets on Saturday
nights, with the certain knowledge that your skirts
were bedraggled, and your feet cold and wet, and
that the money in the thin worn purse had come
perilously near to nothingness. Oh&mdash;that must be
good indeed!</p>

<p>She went back into the house&mdash;with a strange
feeling that to-night something had happened that
had changed her; she would never be able to make-believe
any more as she had done. The touch of the
boy's lips upon her hand had wakened something
in her that had merely lain dormant; she cried out
dumbly for her natural and proper birthright. The
world held something better for her, and it was
denied her; she found herself wondering, without
being able to put the question into words, whether
she would ever get that which belonged to her, by
right of the fact that she was a woman, and young.</p>

<p>Mr. Aubrey Meggison came in presently, and insisted
on telling her of a few shots he had taken that
night on the billiard-table&mdash;illustrating his words
by means of a walking-stick on the shabby cover of
the dining-room table&mdash;and how he had completely
"wiped the floor" with his opponent, to the unbounded
astonishment of a choice circle which seemed
to consist of a billiard-marker, a bookmaker, and a
long-dethroned music-hall star. The triumphs of
the evening, however, had not smoothed his temper;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
he complained bitterly about the monotony of bread
and cheese, and pushed his food from him with a
few elegant expressions of disgust.</p>

<p>"Tact and forethought&mdash;that's what you're
lackin', Bess," he suggested. "You don't think to
yourself what's the best thing to suit your brother,
and your brother's appetite. Not you; the first
thing that comes along'll do for him."</p>

<p>She bore his reproaches meekly, until presently
he restlessly wandered out of the house again. He
encountered his father on the doorstep; and Bessie
heard a little wordy warfare between the two&mdash;Daniel
Meggison protesting virtuously that his son
should be in bed at ten o'clock to the minute&mdash;and
that son suggesting airily that he knew what was
best for himself. Then Daniel came into the room,
not too steadily, but perhaps with the greater dignity
on that account.</p>

<p>"What I've done this night will not soon be forgotten,"
he said, with a roll of the head. "On
their knees, they were, in a manner of speaking&mdash;on
their knees, my child. Nothing good enough for
me; apologies flying about everywhere. Haughty
with them, mind you; no sudden giving way on my
part. At the same time&mdash;condescending; that's
the right word&mdash;condescending." He sat down,
and waved his hand to show exactly what manner
he had adopted for the subjugation of the Arcadia
Arms, and fell asleep.</p>

<p>The shabby little room seemed intolerable, with
the old man gurgling and choking, and muttering
in his sleep in his chair; once again the girl slipped
out into her garden. And now, as if to welcome her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
the kindly moon had come over the housetops, and
was shedding a radiance even there. She sat down
at the table, and leant her elbows upon it; she did
not understand what this new and desperate longing
was that had come upon her. She had been content
for so many years; had been glad to accept things
as they were, and to make the best of them. But
now to-night there was a new and passionate longing
for a world and a life that could never be hers
at all. As she sat there, staring at the shabby wall
before her, the walls seemed to vanish; and there
grew up in their place a dim vision of a wide countryside,
lying silent and peaceful under the moon;
of a life that was gentle and secure and easy. And
beyond that wide countryside, with a path of light
made across it by the moon, lay the shining sea.
The vision was gone, just as rapidly as it had come;
the grey wall was there; out in the street coarse
hoarse voices sounded, and a shout of discordant
laughter. She let her hands fall on the table, and
bowed her head upon her arms. What had she to
do with dreams?</p>

<p>It was at that precise moment that Mr. Gilbert
Byfield determined to walk out of the house next
door into that plot of ground attached to it which
matched that in which Bessie Meggison was seated.
That particular plot of ground did not boast any
of the adornments of the Meggison garden; it was
simply a stretch of bare earth, with scrubby grass
growing here and there in patches. Gilbert thought
nothing of that, because the place did not interest
him, save for the fact that it adjoined the garden
next door; and he had already learned that in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
garden only was the Princess of Arcadia Street to
be approached, if one did it delicately. Accordingly
he stole up to the dividing wall now, and peered
over it; and so, of course, saw that hopeless figure
in the moonlight, leaning over the old table.</p>

<p>As he had never seen her save with that demure
brightness upon her that seemed to belong to her,
he was naturally shocked at this sudden abandonment;
besides, she looked pathetic indeed in her
utter loneliness in that place. He called softly to
her over the wall.</p>

<p>"Hullo! I say&mdash;what's the matter?"</p>

<p>He called so softly that she did not hear him, nor
did she change her position. After a moment of
hesitation, he glanced first at the back of the house
he had left, and then at the back of the other one;
swung himself up to the top of the wall; and jumped
over. He alighted, as luck would have it, on that
defective board in the old box set under the wall;
swore softly to himself, and stepped down to the
ground. The noise he made had startled the girl;
she got quickly to her feet, and moved away from
him.</p>

<p>"I'm dreadfully sorry," he began, smiling at her.</p>


<p>But she waved him back hurriedly. "Mr. Byfield!"
she said in a whisper, with a glance at the
house. "Oh, please&mdash;you must go back!&mdash;you
must really go back!"</p>

<p>"If anyone comes, I can jump over in a moment,"
he said. "There's nothing to be afraid of&mdash;and
this is ever so much better than talking over the wall,
you know. By the way," he added ruefully, "I'm
afraid I've broken your&mdash;your ottoman."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>"It doesn't matter," she said in a dull voice&mdash;"and
it isn't an ottoman. It's an old box."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it," he exclaimed. "It's an ottoman&mdash;and
a very nice one at that."</p>

<p>"You're laughing at me," she said, with the shyness
of a child. "You know it's all only pretending;
you know what a shabby place this is&mdash;really and
truly. You've been good and kind about it; you've
never laughed at me, like other people."</p>

<p>"God forbid, child!"</p>

<p>"That's it!" she exclaimed quickly. "Child!
That's what you think me; that's what you believe
me to be. If a child brought you a broken doll,
you'd be sorry, and make much of it, although in
your heart you'd laugh, because it was such a little
thing to make a fuss about. And you've been sorry
for me&mdash;and have pretended with me that this
place was what it has never been. And in your heart
you have never ceased to laugh at me."</p>

<p>"In my heart I have never laughed at you at all,"
he said solemnly.</p>

<p>They had unconsciously drawn nearer to each
other in the solitude of the garden under the moon;
their hands were touching. For now it seemed that
she wanted desperately to touch hands with some
friendly being&mdash;someone, for choice, who came out
of the big world mysteriously, as this man had done.
She was so much of a child that she needed comforting;
so much of a woman that she needed loving.</p>

<p>"I was wrong to say that you had laughed at
me," she said penitently&mdash;"you have been the only
one that has understood. I wonder if you remember
when you first looked over the wall?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>"Shall I ever forget it!" he exclaimed, in all
honesty. "You see, I had never imagined any place
like this"&mdash;he glanced round about him, and whimsically
shook his head as he spoke&mdash;"and of course
I was surprised. And then I saw you&mdash;and I understood
at once that you were so different from
anyone I had seen in Arcadia Street, or indeed anywhere.
And so we&mdash;we talked."</p>

<p>"I shall never forget it," she said. "I had always
tried to make-believe a little, because when one
does that one gets away from all the tiresome things&mdash;all
the things that <i>must</i> happen, and yet that
ought not to happen at all. You see, so many people
seem always to have held out hands to me
for money; and I've had so little money to give
them."</p>

<p>"And so&mdash;just to enable you to forget them a
little&mdash;you started this great game of make-believe;
this pretending that you were something better
(although that could never be, you know)&mdash;something
bigger and greater than you really were.
The fine lady walked in her garden every night,
and saw the flowers grow, and heard the summer wind
rustling the trees and dreamed&mdash;what great dreams
they were!"</p>

<p>She nodded, with shining eyes. "And then you
one day looked over the wall&mdash;and you seemed to
understand in a moment. Any one else but you,
coming out of the big world, would simply have
laughed, and would have seen that this was an old
carpet, too shabby even for the house&mdash;and this
a table we couldn't use for anything else&mdash;and that
a box that no one wanted. And yet in a moment&mdash;do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
you remember?&mdash;you knew perfectly what each
thing was. It was wonderful!"</p>

<p>"I remember." He nodded gravely. "I knew
that was the ottoman&mdash;and behind it the tapestry;
I understood also how nice it was to have coffee in
the garden every evening. Arcadia Street doesn't
run to coffee&mdash;except in the morning."</p>

<p>"I had read somewhere&mdash;it was in a paper that
came to the house&mdash;that ladies and gentlemen take
their coffee generally on the terrace. Well, of
course, we couldn't manage a terrace, and I couldn't
quite understand whether it was anything like the
terrace you get to round the corner, with the houses
in a sort of half-circle, and the little bit of green
in front; only somehow I knew it couldn't be quite
like that; all I understood was that it was out of
doors. So then I understood the best thing I could
do was to make the most of the garden; and it really
isn't half bad&mdash;is it?"</p>

<p>"It's a pity it isn't better appreciated," he said.</p>

<p>"Father said he didn't understand what I was
driving at; and then he always seemed to find the
hole in the carpet and to trip over it. And Amelia
doesn't really make very good coffee; it's the sort
you dare not stir too much."</p>

<p>"Poor little Miss Make-Believe!" he said, a little
sorrowfully. "I wonder what you would do if the
time came when some of your dreams came true, when
you didn't have to make-believe any more; when you
walked out of this place, and left behind all the
shabby pretences of it. I wonder what you would
say then?"</p>

<p>"That's never likely to happen," she said, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
a shake of the head. "Father doesn't seem to belong
to the rich side of the family. His sister, who
was here to-night&mdash;Aunt Julia, you know&mdash;has
lots of money; she owns houses, you know, and lives
in Clapham."</p>

<p>"Wonderful Aunt Julia!" he said.</p>

<p>"Father has said over and over again that if he
had what he deserves he would be a rich man. I don't
quite know what he means; he's never very explicit
about it. But sometimes at night, when he comes
home from&mdash;from his club, he cries a little, poor
dear, and tells me what he would give me if only he
had what he ought to have. And I know he would,
too; he is really very generous by nature."</p>

<p>Gilbert Byfield knew enough of the girl's story
by that time not to need to ask questions. Ever
since that first meeting with her, when he had carefully
gained her confidence over the wall, he had been
able, by the simple process of piecing together her
innocent answers to his questions, to understand
what she did, and what sort of struggle she was constantly
engaged in. He summed up the shiftless
father and the shiftless son easily enough; understood,
from the type of lodgers that came to the
house, how difficult it must be for this girl to make
both ends meet. Most he admired her unflinching
courage, and above all that curious fanciful child-like
nature that nothing had been able to crush or
stamp out of her. With the most innocent feeling in
the world, he had fostered that, and encouraged it.</p>

<p>It had been hard at times to remember that she
was not a child, and that he had no right to treat
her as such; it had, above all things, been difficult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
for him to tell himself, over and over again, that the
life he lived in Arcadia Street was a sham, and that
he was not the poor man he seemed to be to her. She
had been frankness itself with him, and he should
have been with her in return. Only of course he
knew that, once she understood that he was playing
a part, her confidence in him, as someone as poor
as herself and as struggling, would be gone. For a
period not yet defined in any way he intended to keep
that fiction alive, and remain near her. And in that
again there was no real motive, save one of pity for
the girl.</p>

<p>He asked a question now that had been on his lips
many and many a time, and yet that he had not
uttered before. They were standing together near
the table, and she had one hand resting upon it;
he noticed how short the sleeve was, and guessed that
she must long since have outgrown this dress, and
many others she possessed. He remembered suddenly
that her dresses had always seemed short.
"How old are you, little Make-Believe?" he asked.</p>

<p>"More than eighteen," she said; and laughed
and blushed.</p>

<p>A shadow darkened the doorway of the house, and
a man stood there. Gilbert Byfield stood quite still,
watching; for his presence there would need explanation.
The girl had drawn away from him, and
was peering at the man in the doorway; she spoke
his name hesitatingly at last&mdash;almost apologetically.</p>

<p>"Mr. Quarle?" she asked. "Do you want me?"</p>

<p>The man who stepped out from the doorway was
a thickly-set man of between fifty and sixty years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
of age, with thin grey hair and with a somewhat
sour-looking face. His shoulders were very broad,
and he had the appearance almost of a man whose
head has been set too far forward; the sharp clean-shaven
face was thrust well out, as though the man
spent his time in peering into everything about him.
He carried his hands locked behind him; his voice
was rather harsh. Certainly there was nothing amiable-looking
about him.</p>

<p>"I don't want you&mdash;but your father's asking
for you," said the man.</p>

<p>"I'll go in at once," said Bessie. "Oh&mdash;Mr.
Quarle," she added nervously, slipping her hand
through the arm of the man, and drawing him forward
a little&mdash;"this is Mr. Byfield&mdash;a friend of
mine."</p>

<p>"Pleased to know you, sir," said Quarle, with a
face that belied his words. "New lodger?"</p>

<p>"I live&mdash;next door," said Gilbert, a little lamely.
For the girl had run into the house, and the situation
was an absurd one. The only fashion in which he
could leave this man, whose appearance he did not
like, was by an undignified exit over the wall; and
he had no wish for that. He could have gone out
into the little alley behind, but he knew that the door
at the end of his own particular garden was always
kept bolted. So he stood somewhat awkwardly looking
at the newcomer, and wondering whether he had
better say something about the moon, or the warmth
of the night. The man relieved him of the difficulty
by speaking first.</p>

<p>"My name is Simon Quarle," he said, coming a
step or two nearer to the younger man, and lowering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
his voice. "You're not likely to have heard of me;
very few people have, because I keep myself to myself.
It's a habit of mine."</p>

<p>"And a very excellent habit too, I should imagine,"
said Gilbert with meaning.</p>

<p>"I could wish it was a more general habit," retorted
Quarle, with a quick glance at the house.
"Now, sir&mdash;I'm old enough to be your father&mdash;old
enough, under happier circumstances, to be the
father of that girl who has just left us. And the
Lord knows she needs a father badly."</p>

<p>"I believe she has one already," said Gilbert
coldly.</p>

<p>"She supports a drunken reprobate who has that
title," retorted the man, with a snarl. "Perhaps,
if he were worthy of the name, he might have something
to say to a man who sneaks over a back wall
at night to talk to his daughter."</p>

<p>Gilbert made a quick movement towards the man;
Quarle did not flinch, nor did he take his eyes from
the face of the younger man. Again the absurdity
of his position was borne in upon Byfield; more than
that, he seemed to see in this strange creature someone
who had a greater right to say that he was the
friend of Bessie&mdash;a friend of an older standing.</p>

<p>"You simply don't understand," said Gilbert.
"From a younger man I shouldn't stand it&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind my years," said the other. "I'll do
you the justice to believe that yours has simply been
the thoughtlessness of youth&mdash;the carelessness of a
man to whom women are all alike&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I see that you don't understand," broke in Gilbert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
hotly. "I have been genuinely sorry to see this
child slaving for those who should really be supporting
her; I have seen in her something purer and
sweeter than in any woman I have met yet."</p>

<p>"You're right there," said Simon Quarle, with a
nod. "But you'd best leave her alone to her garden,
as she calls it, and to her dreams, and to the
hard workaday world she knows. You belong to
another world; go back to it."</p>

<p>"How do you know I belong to another world?"
demanded Gilbert.</p>

<p>"Because I haven't lived in this one for nearly
sixty years without watching men, and growing to
understand them. You don't belong to Arcadia
Street; you haven't the true stamp of it."</p>

<p>Gilbert took an impatient turn or two about the
garden, and then came back to this strange man,
who had not moved. "But if I tell you that I'm
interested in her&mdash;that I want to help her&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then I tell you that no help you can give her
is of the sort she wants or deserves," said Quarle
steadily. "At the present time, you stand to her
doubtless as someone wonderful, who can talk to her
as no man has talked to her yet&mdash;understand her
with the understanding of youth. And presently,
when the mood seizes you, you will turn your back
on Arcadia Street, and go off to the world you know
and understand. But you will leave her behind."</p>

<p>Again there was a pause between the two men, and
again the younger one strode about impatiently,
and again the elder one stood still, watching him.
At last Gilbert came back to where Simon Quarle
was standing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>"I beg your pardon if I spoke hastily just now,"
he said. "I had no right to do that, because no man
would speak as you have done unless he was her
friend."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said the other simply. "Anything
else?"</p>

<p>"I want to help her&mdash;I want to lift her out of
this slum in which she lives&mdash;make some of her
dreams come true. I am rich; I can do many things
secretly without her knowledge."</p>

<p>"You are young; would you marry her?"</p>

<p>"My dear sir&mdash;she's a child. Besides&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Besides&mdash;you belong to another world," broke
in Quarle mockingly. "Get back over your wall,
my friend, and leave her alone. Much better leave
her to her dreams and her fancies, even if they are
never to be realized, than shatter them as you would
shatter them. Get back over your wall."</p>

<p>"You don't understand, and I don't suppose you
ever will," exclaimed Gilbert quickly. "But I shall
find a way to help her yet."</p>

<p>"Perhaps&mdash;perhaps," said Simon Quarle, nodding
his head slowly. "But for the present get back
over your wall!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />

<small>THE PRINCESS GOES TO DINNER</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>THAT absurd business of climbing the wall again
had to be got over, and was safely accomplished;
to do him justice, Mr. Simon Quarle refrained
from watching Gilbert's departure, and so
took away one pang at least. The last vision Gilbert
had of him was as he dropped over into the other
garden, and, looking back, saw the old man standing
with his hands clasped behind his back, and his bent
shoulders turned towards where Gilbert had disappeared,
and his eyes fixed upon the opposite wall.</p>

<p>But whatever resolution Gilbert Byfield may have
formed to help the girl, and to lift her out from the
sordid life in which he had found her, for the present
he did nothing. Indeed, for the moment he decided
after a restless night to abandon Arcadia
Street altogether, and to touch again that life to
which he most properly belonged. He would go
back into that artificial existence, and, looking on
this picture and on that, would decide clearly which
was the most worthy. Which is to say in other words
that the old life still drew him, and that this quixotic
thing about which he had concerned himself
could be easily laid aside, for a time at least.</p>

<p>Thus it happened that Mr. Jordan Tant, in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
extremely neat and trim chambers, was informed by
his extremely neat and trim man-servant one morning
that Mr. Byfield had arrived. At the same moment
the man-servant was thrust aside, and Gilbert
strode in.</p>

<p>"Now, I don't want a lot of fuss, or a lot of talk,"
said Gilbert, a little impatiently; "you've just got
to accept me as I am, and not talk about what I have
been, or what I have done. You should know by this
time that I cut up my life into slices; and when one
slice is done with I go on to the next with a new
appetite. Arcadia Street is gone&mdash;lost somewhere
in the wilds of Islington. I am back again in civilization.
What's the news?"</p>

<p>"There's no news that I'm aware of," said Mr.
Tant, a little sulkily. "What news should there
be?"</p>

<p>"Something's upset you, Tant," said Gilbert,
with a laugh. "Come, now&mdash;I'm sure to hear
about it sooner or later; why not tell me now?"</p>

<p>Jordan Tant stood with his arms folded, and his
head a little on one side, and with an aggressive
shoulder turned towards the other man. When he
began to speak he shook himself almost in the fashion
of a spoilt child that resents an injury.</p>

<p>"It isn't fair," he said, in his thin voice; "it
really isn't fair. You go away for an unlimited
time, and in a sense you leave the field to me. I cultivate
that field; I'm careful about it; I am attentive
and anxious&mdash;in fact, I work very hard. Then
suddenly you step in, and if I may use such a term
in so delicate a matter&mdash;you gather the crop."</p>

<p>"My dear Tant, you are really more Tant-like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
than ever," said Gilbert. "Why won't you tell me
what you really mean in half a dozen words?"</p>

<p>"One word will suffice," said Jordan, turning
upon him, and speaking with a sort of mild fierceness.
"And that one word is&mdash;'Enid.' While
you've been living in your blessed Arcadia Street,
on bread and cheese and moonshine, I've been seeing
much of Miss Ewart-Crane; and there has been a
gradually increasing respect for me in the family.
You have shamefully neglected the lady; I have
given her companionship. Now you turn up again,
and will doubtless be welcomed with open arms, as
having returned to the fold. For you will the fatted
calf be prepared; I shall be lucky if I'm invited to
the feast at all."</p>

<p>"My dear Tant," said Gilbert, laughing, "you
are jumping at conclusions. Because I walk out of
Arcadia Street, and come back here, is it to be said
that I am about to take up the old life again in the
old way? Am I going to call on the fair Enid, and
stay to lunch&mdash;or perhaps drop in, in immaculate
garments, for afternoon tea; or dine with her and
her esteemed mother in a state of hopeless boredom;
and take them afterwards to a theatre where the
play's something I don't want to see? Perish the
thought! I'm going to leave all that sort of thing
to you."</p>

<p>Mr. Jordan Tant shook his head sadly. "It's quite
impossible," he said. "I'm a useful man when there's
no one else about; there you have me in a nutshell.
If you had persisted in your folly, and had remained
in Arcadia Street, it might have happened that some
fine morning, or some fine evening, when Enid was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
more bored than usual, she would have said that
she would put up with me for the rest of her life;
and we should have got on very well. But about
you always," he went on petulantly, "is a species of
storm-cloud&mdash;a very whirlwind of romantic excitement.
Now there's no whirlwind about me&mdash;and
it's really the whirlwind fellows that attract the
girls. One never knows what you're going to do;
while, on the other hand, everyone knows what I'm
going to do every hour of the day. I'm a sort of
damp squib, that just fizzles about on its bit of
ground, and does no harm to anybody; you're a gorgeous
sort of rocket, that might even set fire to a
town if you felt that way inclined. At all events,
while I'm fizzing about down below, you'll be illuminating
your bit of sky."</p>

<p>"You're really most complimentary," said Gilbert
Byfield. "But suppose I tell you that I've no
intention of stepping into the place you have so
laboriously made for yourself&mdash;what then?"</p>

<p>"It wouldn't make the least difference," said Tant,
shaking his head. "Mrs. Ewart-Crane is all for
you; she never ceases to speak of you. I think she
knows that one of these days you'll go back and settle
down comfortably with Enid. You see, the thing is
really arranged."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;nonsense!" exclaimed Gilbert impatiently.
"That was a boy and girl affair&mdash;a sort of arrangement
made between our people, years and years
ago. Besides, suppose I don't want to settle down&mdash;what
then?"</p>

<p>"They'll make you; they'll persuade you," said
Mr. Tant gloomily. "Mrs. Ewart-Crane is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
mother, and has one thought in her mind, and one
only&mdash;Enid's future. You'll simply be told that
you've got to get married. After that, perhaps,
they'll let you run about as much as you like&mdash;that
is, within limits."</p>

<p>"We shall see about that," said his friend. "By
the way, what are you doing to-night? We might
dine together."</p>

<p>"I am taking Enid and her mother to dinner and
to the theatre," said Mr. Tant with dignity. "Perhaps
you'd like to suggest that you will go too?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Gilbert, with alacrity. "Most
kind of you; I'll join you with pleasure."</p>

<p>"I knew it!" Mr. Jordan Tant threw up his
hands in a sort of comical despair. "I can see myself
escorting Mrs. Ewart-Crane all the evening,
and compelled to be polite while inwardly boiling.
It's a very unfair world."</p>

<p>Just as Gilbert was going Mr. Tant called him
back, to deliver a word of warning. "Understand
me clearly, Byfield," he said, "I will not have you
springing in suddenly in any dramatic fashion.
You shall be announced in a commonplace way&mdash;your
return referred to as something quite of an ordinary
kind. I will fetch the ladies this evening, but
I shall tell them that you await us at the restaurant.
There shall be no surprises."</p>

<p>"I don't want any surprises," said Gilbert, laughing.</p>

<p>Despite all his precautions, Mr. Tant found himself
as usual very much in the background when it
came to that moment of meeting between the gentleman
from Arcadia Street and Mrs. Ewart-Crane<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
and her daughter. Mr. Tant had made all arrangements
for a very excellent dinner; and he endeavoured,
with what dignity he might, to take the head
of affairs. But Enid was anxious to know everything
concerning a certain Arcadia Street that had
been spoken of, and she leaned eagerly towards Gilbert,
demanding to know what he had been doing,
and if it was really true that he had lived among
people who were a sort of savages&mdash;and what he
had had to eat, and how he had managed to live at
all.</p>

<p>"There's nothing remarkable about it at all,"
said Mr. Tant savagely. "Anyone would think that
he had been exploring some wild region where the
foot of man had never trod; instead of which, he's
simply been living in a very thickly populated part
of London, within a cab fare of his own home&mdash;and
all for a whim! Besides, slumming's out of
date."</p>

<p>"It wasn't exactly slumming&mdash;and besides, he
really went to study the people&mdash;didn't you, Gilbert?"
asked Enid, in her high voice. She was a
tall, handsome girl, with a good carriage, and an
abundance of good health and spirits; this evening
she was particularly glad to see her old friend back
again in his place among men.</p>

<p>"What I never can understand," said Mrs. Ewart-Crane,
adjusting a bracelet on a very well-formed
arm, "is why we need study men at all&mdash;or women,
for the matter of that. I grant you that in your
own sphere you are naturally interested in the people
about you; but beyond that I decline to go."</p>

<p>"Exactly, my dear Mrs. Ewart-Crane," broke in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Tant. "Just what I always say: let us remember
always the dividing line, and stick to it. We should
get jumbled up in the most horrible way if we didn't
remember the dividing line always, and above all, if
we didn't remember that the people who live in the
Arcadia Streets of the world are very right and
proper in their own places, and very wrong and improper
elsewhere. The people of position in this
world are those who have come by right to the top;
it's fellows like Byfield that put wrong notions into
their heads, by mixing with 'em, and coming down,
in a sense, to their level. I assure you that when I
discovered him he was living in a perfectly shocking
place."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ewart-Crane closed her eyes, and shivered.
"Then I'm very glad to think that he's left it," she
said. "For my part, I wish to hear no more about
it; let us regard it as something happily done with
and forgotten."</p>

<p>"But I want to hear about it, mamma," persisted
Enid, laughing good-humouredly. "I'm quite sure
there was an attraction down there&mdash;wasn't there?"
She turned to Gilbert with a smile.</p>

<p>"Many attractions," he replied evasively. "All
sorts of poor people, toiling cheerfully, and having
rather a good time in their own way, in spite of
poverty."</p>

<p>"Don't let him put you off, Miss Enid," said
Tant, a little maliciously. "There was an attraction&mdash;I
saw her, and I heard about her. And I
don't mind saying that she was very pretty."</p>

<p>"Gilbert!" The girl was looking at him quizzically.
"I want to hear all about this. What was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
she like? Big and rather brazen&mdash;quite a child of
nature, with what they call a heart of gold&mdash;eh?
I know the sort."</p>

<p>"I beg again, Enid, that the subject may be
dropped," said Mrs. Ewart-Crane icily. But no one
took the least notice of her.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you don't know the sort," said Gilbert.
He was annoyed at the turn the conversation
had taken&mdash;annoyed, too, at Jordan Tant for his
breach of faith. He hated the thought of discussing
the girl with these people; he knew that the
more he tried to explain his feeling about the matter,
the less they would be able to understand. But the
rather haughty eyes of Enid were upon him, and
he had to go on, against his will. "The girl Tant
is talking about is a little hard-working thing, who
lived in the next house to that in which I stayed;
and she keeps a drunken father and a reprobate
brother by the simple process of letting lodgings.
Now you know all about it."</p>

<p>"How touching&mdash;and how romantic!" exclaimed
the girl. "And the great man from the great world
took a deep interest in her, and stayed perhaps a
little longer in his slum on her account&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"For my part," said Mrs. Ewart-Crane stiffly,
"since the subject must be discussed, I have never
been able to understand what people let lodgings
for. If they've got a house, why not live in it, and
not give over bits of it to other people?"</p>

<p>Gilbert Byfield glanced at his watch. "We shall
be late for the first act," he said.</p>

<p>"Which of course puts an end to the discussion,"
Enid said, as she rose from the table. "Of course,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
if you'd like me to send her anything that would be
useful, I should be only too pleased. Mother likes
me to be charitable."</p>

<p>The play proved to be dull (at least to Gilbert
Byfield), and the evening seemed to stretch on interminably.
For the man was haunted by the miserable
feeling that this child, in her common back-yard&mdash;this
girl he had understood, as he thought, so perfectly&mdash;could
never by any chance be understood
by those who had not intimately touched her life.
He was puzzled to think what he could do to carry
out that brave determination of his to help her&mdash;to
lift her out of her surroundings. If he remained
where he was, among his own people, and in his own
sphere, he deserted the child; if he went back to
her, he deserted them, and took up his life in surroundings
uncongenial, except so far as she was
concerned. And he saw that it was utterly impossible
to go half-way about one matter or the other;
Arcadia Street was not to be brought into the West
End and dumped down there.</p>

<p>It happened that between the acts he went out to
smoke a cigarette, and found himself, with a dozen
other men, near the open doors of the theatre. A
few people were strolling listlessly outside in the
street&mdash;pausing now and then to stare in at the
well-dressed men, and to whisper. And once a girl
went past&mdash;a thin shabby girl in black; and he was
reminded so forcibly of Bessie Meggison that, without
knowing what he did, he hurried out of the place,
and went after her. Fifty yards down the street she
stopped to look in at a shop window; and it was not
Bessie at all, but someone quite different. Yet the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
thought assailed him, as he went back to the theatre,
that just in that fashion the girl might be wandering
alone in this horrible London&mdash;poorly clad, and
not too well fed. He hated the thought of his own
prosperity; quite unnecessarily called himself a
brute, because he had had a good dinner, and was
supposed to be out in search of enjoyment.</p>

<p>Never for a moment, of course, did it occur to
him that his point of view was wrong; never for a
moment did he understand that properly his life
could not touch the girl's, and could have nothing
in common with it. He accused himself unnecessarily,
when the only mistake that had been made in the
whole matter was in going to Arcadia Street at all,
and above all going there under false colours. That
point of view he did not regard in the least.</p>

<p>But he walked home that night, after leaving his
friends, feeling miserably that it would have been
better if he had buried himself for ever in Arcadia
Street; if in some impossible way, he could have
forgotten this selfish purposeless life he had always
lived, and could have flung himself into some real
work that would have brought him nearer in thought
and feeling to the girl. Not for the first time he
cried out against artificiality; metaphorically speaking,
he wanted to put on rough clothing and thick
boots, and plunge into the real fierce work of the
world.</p>

<p>Some sense of the injustice of the world in meting
out such different lots to such different women urged
him, after a lapse of days during which he had been
at the beck and call of Enid, to go back to Arcadia
Street. He told himself that it would be merely an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
experimental visit; he meant to see if something
could not be done to shake old Meggison into an
understanding of his responsibilities, and perhaps
even to urge the derelict brother into an attempt
to earn a living. That was what he told himself;
in the end, of course, it amounted to his going with
the prospect of seeing the girl, and of doing something,
in a wholly indefinite way, for her personally.</p>

<div class="caption">"'I MAY GO AWAY AGAIN AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE.'" <i>Page 66</i></div>
</div>

<p>He was a little shy about meeting her; so many
ridiculous suggestions had been thrown to him by
Jordan Tant, and by Enid and her mother, concerning
this girl, that the old freedom between them, so
far at least as he was concerned, seemed a thing of
the past. Even when that summer evening arrived
when, leaning over the wall, he saw her seated in
her garden, and called to her, it was with a new constraint.</p>

<p>"I've come back, you see," he said.</p>

<p>She was genuinely very glad to see him; he found
himself wondering if the eyes of Enid could by any
chance ever light up at his coming as did the eyes
of this child. Things were different in Arcadia
Street, he knew; almost he wished that they were
not&mdash;almost he wished that this happy familiarity
might obtain in other places with which he was more
naturally in touch.</p>

<p>"I thought&mdash;thought you were not coming
back," said the girl. "And yet I hoped&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hoped that I was&mdash;eh?" he supplemented.
"Even now, I don't know how long I may be able to
stop here; I may go away again at a moment's
notice&mdash;and never come back at all. Don't look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
so grave about it; you can go on making-believe,
you know, just as well as ever."</p>

<p>"It won't be quite the same," she said. "You see,
in that you've helped me&mdash;because, as I told you,
you understood."</p>

<p>"And how have you been getting on?" he asked.
"I mean, of course&mdash;the house?"</p>

<p>She stood against the wall over which he leaned;
she did not look up at him when she replied. "Oh,
pretty well, thank you," she said in a low voice.
"Nothing ever happens, you know, in Arcadia
Street&mdash;except the thing you don't want to happen."</p>

<p>"Your father?"</p>

<p>"Father is quite established again at his club;
they think a lot of him at his club," she said. "And
Aubrey is positive he will hear of something to do
very shortly."</p>

<p>"That's good news," said Gilbert. "By the way&mdash;that
Mr. Quarle I met when I was here last&mdash;the
night I came over into your garden&mdash;do you
know him very well?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; he's been a great friend of mine for
nearly two years. But for him I think we couldn't
keep the house going; he is the only lodger I have
ever had who pays money without being asked for
it. He's simply wonderful. Not that he's well off;
he's only retired from something, and I don't think
the something was very much before he retired from
it. But his payments&mdash;oh&mdash;they're beautifully
regular!"</p>

<p>"He's a valuable man," said Gilbert, not without
a curious little feeling of jealousy that anyone else<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
should be good to the girl except himself. Then
the thought of what he had meant to do&mdash;the remembrance
of the girl, shabby and forlorn, who had
walked past the theatre that night, and had been
something like Bessie Meggison&mdash;urged him to say
something else.</p>

<p>"Bessie&mdash;(you don't mind my calling you Bessie&mdash;do
you?)&mdash;have you ever had a holiday? I
mean, have you ever got away from this dull house
for one long evening&mdash;and seen bright lights, and
happy faces&mdash;and heard music? Have you ever
done that?"</p>

<p>Still leaning against the wall, she shook her head
slowly, without looking up. "There hasn't been
time&mdash;or money," she said simply.</p>

<p>"If you found the time&mdash;and I found the
money?" he suggested. "What then?"</p>

<p>She looked up at him wonderingly; did not seem
for a moment to understand what he meant. At
last she said slowly&mdash;"I'm afraid it wouldn't do,
you know; it really wouldn't do at all. Someone
would be wanting me&mdash;someone would be calling
for me."</p>

<p>"I should let them call for once," said Gilbert.
"Just suppose for once, little Make-Believe, that
we went out of Arcadia Street&mdash;and far beyond
Islington&mdash;just our two selves. There are certain
places called theatres, you know."</p>

<p>She nodded, with a sigh. "I know," she said.
"That is, of course, I don't know much about what
they're like inside; the outsides are wonderful. But
I expect they're very expensive."</p>

<p>"We might manage it&mdash;just for once," he urged.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
"I could save up, you know&mdash;go without something."</p>

<p>It needed a lot of persuasion before she would
consent at all; but at last she named a night when
it was probable that father would be more in requisition
at his club even than usual, and when Aubrey
would be engrossed in the mysteries of a billiard
handicap. She would go then; and, the better to
preserve the proprieties (for Arcadia Street was
given to gossip), would meet him at a certain spot
not a hundred yards from the Arcadia Arms.</p>

<p>He began to understand, almost at the last moment,
that the expedition must be conducted in her
own fashion; he had the delicacy to understand that
he must be shabby to match her poor shabbiness.
So that it is probable very few of his friends would
have recognized Mr. Gilbert Byfield, had they seen
him waiting about at the corner of a certain street
in Islington, in a well-worn tweed suit and a billycock
hat. At that time he did not like the idea at
all; he would have liked to whirl her away in a
hansom, and do the thing properly at a first-class
restaurant, with stalls at a theatre to follow. He
wondered a little how the evening was going to pass.</p>

<p>And yet, after all, it proved to be rather pleasant&mdash;viewed
as a new experience. Pleasant, to begin
with, to see that little thin figure coming towards
him; to hold for a moment the little hand in the
worn glove, and to notice with satisfaction how neat
she was, and how tastefully dressed, despite the poor
things she had on. He had the grace to forget that
a swift hansom might be hailed with the raising of
a hand; found an omnibus almost comfortable&mdash;quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
delightful, in fact, with the girl seated beside
him, wearing upon her face that extraordinary look
of complete happiness. He forgot even to think
what his friends would have said had they seen him
riding in such a vehicle, dressed in such fashion,
and with such a companion.</p>

<p>The choosing of a restaurant was a difficulty, because
he scarcely knew the cheaper or more dingy
ones. She drew back in alarm at the prospect of
entering a place gay with electric light; became
reconciled at last to a little place of few tables and
fewer waiters; sat open-eyed and breathless at the
glory of a fifth-rate place, with a decided smell of
the kitchen about it every time a creaking door was
opened near her. She did not talk much; only occasionally
she glanced at him, and when she did she
smiled that slow grave smile of gratitude and friendliness.</p>

<p>Afterwards he found himself, for the first time
in his life, in the upper circle at a theatre; congratulated
himself on the fact that a friend he saw
in a box below would not be likely to raise his eyes
to the third row of that particular part of the building.
He contented himself, not with looking at a
play he had already seen, but with watching the thin
face of the girl beside him&mdash;the bright eyes and
the half-parted lips. Once, at a moment that was
thrilling, she gripped his arm; and for quite a long
time kept her hand there, holding to him while she
watched the stage.</p>

<p>Coming out of the theatre, in the whirl and rush
of people homeward bound, he got her into the hansom
almost before she knew what had happened;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
it was only after the horse had started for Arcadia
Street that she looked up at him reproachfully&mdash;shocked
and awed by this friend who could spend
so much money in a single evening. She voiced that
thought as they drove along.</p>

<p>"You'll have to go without quite a lot for this,
Mr. Byfield&mdash;won't you?" she asked wistfully. "I
mean&mdash;it has been a frightfully expensive evening."</p>

<p>"I don't mind&mdash;for once," said Gilbert. "The
only question in my mind is&mdash;have you really had
a good time?"</p>

<p>She heaved a big sigh. "I should like to do it all
over again," she said softly&mdash;"but to do it much
more slowly. It has been wonderful!"</p>

<p>This was the one man in all the world that had
ever thought about her, or had ever done her a
kindness. Small wonder then that her eyes spoke
more than gratitude when she put that little hand
into his again in Arcadia Street, before the shabby
house swallowed her up, and the door closed upon
her. No one saw her, because Arcadia Street, save
on Saturday nights, goes early to bed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />

<small>THE GREAT GAME OF MAKE-BELIEVE</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>IN the course of many scrambling, shambling
years Mr. Daniel Meggison had learnt much, in
the sordid sense, concerning the value of men. Had
it been necessary for him, at any time in his later
life, to pass a strict examination in the Gentle Art of
Tapping People, he would in all probability have
come out of the ordeal with flying colours, as one
having vast experience.</p>

<p>For he could have told you to a nicety how, in
the case of this man, you must not try for more
than half a crown, and must be jocular with him;
how, in another case, you might fly higher, and
whine for a sovereign, with a pitiful tale pitched to
charm the coin out of his pockets; and how, in
other cases, you would have to drop your demands
so low as a shilling or even possibly a sixpence. It
is not too much to say that every man, in a very
special sense, had for Mr. Daniel Meggison his
price; and that on all and sundry occasions he was
only too ready to exact that price from his fellows.</p>

<p>Exactly how far back in the years he had really
made any attempt to earn an honest living it is impossible
to say, and he had probably long since forgotten.
It had at the beginning been a mere accidental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
business; a temporary loss of work had
thrown him into the willing arms, as it were, of a
wife who had always done something to help him.
It merely became necessary for her to increase her
efforts; Mr. Meggison was in no hurry to look for
work, and gradually the truth was forced upon him
that he need never do so again. True, he made a
pretence, for something like twelve months, to gain
a livelihood, but with no ardour in the pursuit; and
so gradually drifted into that great and marvellous
army which always in a big city manages to exist
pretty comfortably without working at all.</p>

<p>He learnt their tricks and their ways&mdash;even their
little catch-phrases slipped naturally from his
tongue. He might have been heard talking loudly
concerning the affairs of the nation, and how they
should be conducted; he knew his newspaper by
heart. More than that, he might have been heard
often demanding to know why this man and that did
not obtain the employment that was obviously waiting
for him in a busy world. And so in time he grew
to the belief that he was in all respects something
of a poor gentleman, for whom others must provide
money, and who, by reason of a certain superiority
of birth and education and resources, stood outside
the mere common grubbing workaday world.</p>

<p>There were, of course, mean shifts and petty
frauds to be encountered; but in time the man grew
hardened even to those. There was a bed in which
he might sleep, and there was food for him, and
tobacco always; he became a familiar figure in his
poor neighbourhood, and accepted with each day
that which was provided for him, not without grumbling.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
In time the patient wife folded her hands,
and sighed, and fell asleep; and the patient daughter
took up the burden quite naturally, as it had
been bequeathed to her. The legacy of the shiftless
father, who was always to be protected and looked
after, descended to her, and was taken up as a sacred
trust.</p>

<p>But with that shiftless life that had been his portion
so long the man had not lost his natural cunning&mdash;the
cunning of the creature that preys upon his
fellows. Money was necessary, for the occasional
replenishing of his scanty wardrobe, and for tobacco
and drinks; he would have been a poor thing without
money in his pockets. Hence the borrowing&mdash;hence
the tapping of any and every one with whom
he came in contact. Therefore, too, it is small wonder
that he turned his eyes at last towards Gilbert
Byfield, with something of a smacking of lips. For
here was higher game; here was a man who might,
if handled carefully, be a man of sovereigns instead
of paltry shillings.</p>

<p>The man was not above playing the spy, and he
had of course a jealous interest in the fate of that
chief breadwinner&mdash;his daughter. More than once
he had shivered, with a very genuine horror, at the
prospect of love or marriage being even suggested
to her; had been short with Harry Dorricott, when
he had seen that boy's eyes turn with an unmistakable
look of affection in them in Bessie's direction.
For what, in the name of all that was tragic, was
to become of Mr. Daniel Meggison if his daughter
left him?</p>

<p>From behind the curtain of a window he had seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
the stranger who lived next door talking to the girl
over the wall; had been inclined to resent that at
once. At the same time, he had a craven feeling that
it would not do to upset Bessie; he had better watch,
and be silent. So he had seen other meetings, until
at last that night had arrived when Bessie was not in
the house, and when she came in very late, and crept
up to her room like the guilty truant she was. And
had there not been a sound of wheels outside the
house? Daniel Meggison shivered in his bed, and
wondered what he had done in all his blameless life
to deserve this.</p>

<p>Questioned cautiously on the following morning,
Bessie would say but little. Yes&mdash;she had been out&mdash;all
the evening&mdash;with a friend. No&mdash;she had
not spent money over it; she would not have thought
of doing such a thing; the friend had paid for
everything. She hoped that her father was not annoyed,
and that he had not wanted for anything.</p>

<p>"No, my child, I am not suggesting that I wanted
for anything; I spent the greater part of the evening
at my club," he replied stiffly. "Only, of
course, as a father I am naturally anxious for you&mdash;and
I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It was a very nice friend&mdash;a very nice one indeed,"
she broke in; and he decided that it would
not be wise to pursue the matter then.</p>

<p>For the sake of his very livelihood, however, he
saw that he must be alert; it might even happen that
this precious child would be snatched away from
him. He went to that club of his less frequently;
came into the house at unexpected moments, and
was to be found loitering about on the staircase, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
in rooms in which he had no business. Also he
haunted that garden, and had a watchful eye upon
the house next door. He hungered for another sight
of this man who could afford to pay for an evening's
entertainment, and could travel in cabs.</p>

<p>He knew, of course, that Gilbert Byfield was not
as other men in Arcadia Street. Apart from his
own observation, he knew instinctively that Bessie
had hitherto held aloof from everyone; had gone
about her duties soberly&mdash;a grown woman long
before her time; he did her the justice to know that
no ordinary man would have attracted her attention,
or have drawn her away from the life her father had
mapped out for her even for an hour. More than
that, those who dwell in Arcadia Street have not
money for evening pleasures or for cabs; and there
had been from the beginning a sort of mystery about
this young man who lived next door. Mr. Meggison
determined to lie in wait for that young man,
and to confront him.</p>

<p>He began artfully. On one particular evening
he did not, as usual, shuffle off down the street, with
his pipe between his teeth; he waited about in the
house instead. Bessie hinted that she supposed he
would be going out soon; he declared that he would
wait a little while; he might not, in fact, be going
out at all. He seated himself in his shabby easy
chair, and declared that he was very comfortable
where he was. He had been too much at the club of
late; home was the proper place for the man and
the head of a family, after all.</p>

<p>Bessie was moving towards the garden, when he
sat up and called to her. "I dislike the idea of your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
sitting out in that garden so much in the evening,
my child," he said, with a new tenderness that was
startling to the girl. "Here you've been cooped
up in the house all day long&mdash;no fresh air&mdash;no
exercise; and now you expect to go and sit out there.
We must take care of you, Bessie. Much better go
for a walk."</p>

<p>"But I like the garden, father," the girl urged
faintly.</p>

<p>"For to-night, my dear&mdash;to please me," said
Daniel Meggison, with an unaccustomed smile&mdash;"go
for a walk. There may be little matters of
shopping which you ordinarily leave to Amelia; go
yourself on this occasion; you will probably buy
more economically than she will. You must think
of these matters in dealing with a household. Come,
Bessie, I know what is best for you; put your hat
on, and go out."</p>

<p>She kissed him obediently, and thanked him for
his care of her; and went out into the hot streets.
She was disappointed, because the garden would
have been welcome, and it might just have happened
that a face would look over the wall and a voice call
to her; and then the ending of the day would be
good and complete.</p>

<p>But Daniel Meggison, like greater men before
him, had a motive. He desired to draw that shy
being who dwelt on the other side of the wall; to
come face to face with him, if possible, and discover
something about him. He argued that it was a rare
thing for Bessie not to be in the garden late in the
evening if the weather happened to be fine, and that
the man on the other side of the wall would be naturally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
surprised, and perhaps alarmed. Mr. Daniel
Meggison chuckled to himself at the thought of his
own cunning, and sat down in such a position that
he could watch the garden. He had not long to
wait.</p>

<p>Mr. Gilbert Byfield was confident that on this particular
evening the girl would be in the garden;
and he wanted to talk to her. She had rather
avoided him during these past few days, and he had
already come to understand that Arcadia Street was
a remarkably dull place, unless it was actually represented
by her. Consequently, on this evening he
had determined that he would see her, if possible,
and that he would have a little tender whimsical explanation
with her, in which, appropriately enough,
he would play the part of a species of elderly friend
or brother, and would in fact be very good to her.
He recognized that that feeling of protective tenderness
for the girl was growing; but he told himself
sternly that it was, of course, merely the protective
tenderness of a friend. On that point he was
very strong. He had come back to Arcadia Street
because he was interested in her; and when the time
came for him to leave Arcadia Street he would, of
course, leave it with regret on her account. He
would not think about it to-night; he simply recognized
that the time was coming when he must know
Arcadia Street no more.</p>

<p>An inspection of the garden over the wall showed
it to be empty, but the lighted house was beyond.
It occurred to him that in all probability she had
stepped inside for a moment; he would get over the
wall, and would surprise her when she came out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
again. He did so, and, carefully avoiding the broken
boards in the ottoman that was not an ottoman,
made his way cautiously towards the house. He sat
down on one of the rickety chairs near the crazy
table, and waited.</p>

<p>This was Mr. Daniel Meggison's opportunity.
He rose with an air of importance, and laid down
his pipe; pulled down his waistcoat, and set his
smoking-cap a little rakishly on one side of his head;
and sauntered out. He went with the air of a gentleman
about to gaze upon the beauty of the evening;
his face was indeed turned towards the sky
at the moment that he emerged from the door and
stepped on to the ragged old carpet.</p>

<p>Gilbert Byfield had risen, in the surprise of the
encounter; he stood watching old Meggison. Meggison,
for his part, allowed his eyes to come down
from their contemplation of the stars, and so gradually
to rest upon the intruder who stood before him.
He gave a very fine start, in the most approved
fashion, and then stood in a dignified attitude, with
a hand thrust into his waistcoat, looking at Gilbert
up and down.</p>

<p>"Sir!" exclaimed Meggison.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I beg your pardon," stammered Gilbert,
looking helplessly at the wall over which he had
scrambled.</p>

<p>"Sir&mdash;you are an intruder&mdash;a trespasser upon
the privacy of my family, my home, and my property!"
said Mr. Meggison, keeping his voice remarkably
low, and watching the door leading to the
house. "What do you mean by it, sir?&mdash;what do
you want?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>"There is nothing to make a fuss about, Mr.
Meggison," said Gilbert quietly. "I live next door
here; I came over in order to have a word or two
with&mdash;with your daughter."</p>

<p>"Nothing to make a fuss about?" echoed Meggison,
still in those cautious tones. "Came over to
see my daughter? And what do you suppose, sir,
her father will have to say to such a proceeding?"</p>

<p>"I do not wish to be offensive, Mr. Meggison,"
said the younger man&mdash;"but I fancy her father
has not troubled very much about her until this moment.
Don't bluster, sir; I am her friend before
everything else."</p>

<p>Daniel Meggison took a step forward, and looked
at the other; took a step back, and rolled his head
threateningly; took another step forward, and laid
a hand on Byfield's arm. "Sir," he said solemnly&mdash;"I
am sure of it. Only you must forgive the
anger and the suspicion of a parent to whom his
child is very precious. She has no mother, sir."</p>

<p>"I know that," said Gilbert. "I had no right,
of course, to trespass on your premises, Mr. Meggison&mdash;for
that I owe you an apology. But
I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not another word, sir&mdash;not another word, I
beg," exclaimed Meggison, taking his hand and
wringing it. "I like the look of you, sir; I like
the blunt fearlessness with which you scramble over
a wall; you are a man, sir!"</p>

<p>"You're very good," replied Gilbert awkwardly.
"Is Miss&mdash;Miss Meggison in the house? I should
like to speak to her."</p>

<p>"My daughter, sir, has gone out," said Meggison,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
seating himself, and waving a hand grandiloquently
towards the other chair, "on a necessary
errand connected with household matters. Poor
child&mdash;poor child; I wish sometimes she did not
have to work so hard."</p>

<p>"So do I," said Gilbert, looking squarely at him.
"She's young, you know, Meggison&mdash;hardly more
than a child; and all her youth is slipping away,
and she'll only know too late that it's gone. It seems
a pity, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>Daniel Meggison sniffed audibly, and turned his
head away; began slowly and methodically to search
himself, until presently he drew from out his clothing
a doubtful-looking handkerchief. This he applied
first to one eye, and then to the other.</p>

<p>"Youth, sir, is a beautiful thing," he said. He
gave a glance towards the house, and then leant
across the table, and laid a hand on the arm of the
younger man; he still kept that handkerchief to one
eye, but the other was bright and alert. "Don't
misunderstand me; don't think that I speak lightly.
I have watched that child grow up&mdash;like a flower,
sir. I have lain awake at night thinking about her&mdash;wondering
about her&mdash;planning for her. I
have mentioned to friends at my&mdash;my club that
I am tortured concerning her. 'What,' I have
asked, 'is to become of one so tender&mdash;so loving
to an unfortunate father&mdash;so willing to work for
that unfortunate father?' That is the question I
have asked others as well as myself. Mr. Byfield,
she is not strong; in other words, she is very frail.
Her mother was never strong; I worshipped her
mother, and her mother (I can say it with pride)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
was devoted to me. You are her friend&mdash;Bessie's
friend, I mean; has it ever occurred to you that
she is not strong? I am her father&mdash;you will understand
my anxiety."</p>

<p>Gilbert Byfield had got up with some impatience
from his chair, and had moved away down the length
of the garden. For a moment he could not trust
himself to speak, or to answer that hypocritical
whining voice. He knew, however, that if he was
to do anything to help the girl he must control himself,
and must make what use he could of the one
instrument ready to his hand. So he walked back
to the table, and stood there, with his hands in his
pockets, looking down at the old man.</p>

<p>"I am glad we think alike," he said slowly. "I
do not think she is strong; it is a thousand pities
that she cannot be taken out of this place&mdash;a thousand
pities that she has to work so hard to&mdash;to
support other people."</p>

<p>"I agree with you," said Meggison, eagerly getting
up from his chair, and coming hurriedly round
the table to the young man. "Sometimes, sir," he
exclaimed, with a sort of feeble passion&mdash;"sometimes
I am roused almost to madness at the thought that
I am so helpless&mdash;that I can do nothing. The
truth of the matter is that I was never brought up
to do anything&mdash;not anything that would pay; I
blame my parents bitterly for that. My late wife&mdash;devoted
soul!&mdash;would often say that I was never
really fitted to cope with the world. 'You are by
nature and by instinct, Daniel, a gentleman and a
man of leisure,' she would say; 'it seems natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
that others should provide for you.' And she knew
me&mdash;knew me intimately, sir."</p>

<p>"I'm sure she did," said Gilbert, looking at him
steadily. "But we are wandering from the subject
a little&mdash;the subject of your daughter. Her
mother is gone; it is not too late to do something
for the child."</p>

<p>"True&mdash;very true," exclaimed Meggison, with
an air of deep determination. "Bless you, my dear
sir! Now&mdash;what shall we do? Let's put our heads
together."</p>

<p>As though he meant to carry that suggestion into
effect literally, Mr. Daniel Meggison pushed the old
smoking-cap a little further on to one side of his
head, and leaned nearer to his companion, and assumed
a very wise expression. Gilbert, with a
glance at the house, began to speak in a cautious
tone.</p>

<p>"It has to be understood, of course, in the first
place, that whatever is done is done for the girl
only. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>Mr. Meggison stared at him almost with indignation;
he opened his eyes very wide. "Of course&mdash;of
course&mdash;Bessie only. You leave that to me; I'll
see to that."</p>

<p>"I'll see to that also," retorted Gilbert. "In
the second place, whatever is done is done by you."</p>

<p>"By me?" The man stared at him with growing
uneasiness. "But I can't&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I mean that whatever is done for the girl must
be done for her by her father&mdash;so far as she knows.
She is the last in the world to accept anything from
me, and I would not ask her to do so; it would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
an insult. I ask you to do so"&mdash;(Mr. Meggison
pocketed that insult cheerfully, and said nothing)&mdash;"because
through you I can do what I could not
do for myself. For example, if we are to help this
poor daughter of yours, money will be required."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;of course&mdash;money," replied Mr. Meggison,
rubbing his hands, and nodding his head many
times. "Oh, yes&mdash;of course money."</p>

<p>"And that must come through her father, as the
only proper person who can give it to her. Again,
in other words, Meggison, it becomes necessary, in
order that this whim of mine may be carried out,
that you and I should have a little secret understanding
with each other. Whatever is necessary
to be paid, I shall pay you, and you in turn will
pay&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Somebody else," broke in Meggison, nodding
again, and laying a forefinger against the side of his
nose. "Splendid notion&mdash;and very easy&mdash;eh?"
He coughed, and hesitated for a moment. "Should
I, for instance&mdash;begin to-night?"</p>

<p>"I think not," said Gilbert quietly.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;you think not," Meggison replied with a
look of disappointment. "Well&mdash;perhaps you
know best. What are your plans? I'm a man for
hurry always."</p>

<p>"My plans depend to a great extent upon you,"
said Gilbert. "I do not imagine for a moment that
you are possessed of any sum of money?"</p>

<p>"I am a most unfortunate man, sir, to whom
much money should have come had Fate treated me
better. But I am not worth sixpence."</p>

<p>"Briefly, my plan is this," went on Gilbert, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
a pause. "I would like to give Bessie a sight of the
better world that lies outside Arcadia Street; not
the world of London, and London streets and sights
and sounds; but that bigger world for which she
longs&mdash;that freer world of trees and flowers and
blue skies. In other words, I would like to give her
a holiday. Now, can you by any possibility suggest
some reason why you should suddenly come into a
little money, Mr. Meggison?"</p>

<p>"I can suggest a hundred reasons&mdash;but they
would be equally romantic and absurd," said Meggison,
scratching the top of the smoking-cap thoughtfully.
"A rich relative of whom she has never
heard&mdash;no&mdash;that wouldn't do, because she knows
all my relatives. Work that suddenly brings in a
lot of money?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. No&mdash;she wouldn't believe in
work, so far as I'm concerned; that would require
too great a stretch of the imagination, I'm afraid.
A lucky speculation?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. No&mdash;one requires capital
for that."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you'll have to fall back on a relative&mdash;a
distant relative&mdash;very much removed. Understand,
it would only be a small legacy."</p>

<p>"May I ask what you exactly mean by the term
'small'?" asked Daniel Meggison.</p>

<p>"I would suggest a sum of about fifty pounds,"
said Gilbert quietly.</p>

<p>Mr. Daniel Meggison opened his mouth very wide,
and then shut it with a snap; opened it again, as
though intending to speak; and blurted out a faint
echo of the sum that had been named.</p>

<p>"Fifty&mdash;fifty pounds!" Mr. Meggison came
nearer, and touched Gilbert, as though to discover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
whether or not he was actually real. Then suddenly
and harshly he burst out laughing. "Fifty pounds,
indeed! Don't attempt to fool me, please. Where
will you get such a sum&mdash;and you in Arcadia
Street?"</p>

<p>"I have not always been in Arcadia Street, and
I shall not always remain here," said Gilbert. "As
the world understands it, I am rather a rich man,
and the fifty pounds is quite easily to be found. I
am living in Arcadia Street for a whim, if you must
know; that is part of our secret understanding,
Mr. Meggison. Come, now&mdash;is it a bargain?"</p>

<p>Daniel Meggison looked at the young man for
only one moment longer; then he seemed to leap at
him, and to catch his hand between both his own.
"A bargain, sir?" he exclaimed, in a rapture. "Of
course it's a bargain&mdash;and in a noble cause, sir.
Fifty pounds, did you say? It's a fortune!"</p>

<p>"A fortune into which you have very strangely
come," Gilbert reminded him. "Don't say a word
now; I can see your daughter coming straight
through the house towards us. Come round and see
me to-morrow, and we'll work out together this game
of make-believe which you are to play."</p>

<p>"I'll play it well until the end!" exclaimed Meggison,
shaking his hand again. "A great game of
make-believe! Splendid notion!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />

<small>SCHEMERS AND DREAMERS</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>BESSIE MEGGISON had no suspicion; for it
was scarcely possible, in the first place, that
anyone should be interesting himself on her behalf.
She was glad to think that her father and Mr. Byfield
had suddenly grown to be to all appearances
such excellent friends; although even in that there
was a lurking dread, lest the wily Daniel Meggison
should exercise that "tapping" process upon his
new acquaintance. For the rest, it simplified matters,
and made it easier to carry on that innocent
intercourse with Gilbert.</p>

<p>The plotters meanwhile may be said to have
watched each other's movements with suspicion and
distrust. Daniel Meggison was all for immediate
action; wanted to feel his fingers grasping that
good money, and putting it to such uses as only
he, from a long experience, could accurately name.
Bessie should, of course, have a share in the good
things that were coming; but only, quite properly,
after her father had been satisfied; quixotic notions
were not to be encouraged where a rich young man
absolutely offered to toss fifty pounds over a garden
wall in Islington. Gilbert Byfield, on the other hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
already began to doubt whether after all he had
not been a little precipitate; began to suggest this,
and to demand that, in the way of security. Not
that he regretted his action so far as Bessie was
concerned; a single glance at her white face was
sufficient to speed him to the undertaking; but he
doubted the instrument he had been compelled to
choose.</p>

<p>Daniel Meggison's idea of a rest and a holiday
for his daughter, when it came to the actual point
of expression, seemed to consist in a vague notion
of driving about London all day long, with large
cigars for his own consumption, and new clothes,
and an occasional visit with some ceremony to a
saloon bar; which was not of course quite the idea
that had been in the mind of Mr. Gilbert Byfield.
The wily old man had already drawn sundry sovereigns,
on account of that imaginary fortune, and
still nothing had been done, when one evening he
appeared in Gilbert Byfield's rooms with a face of
mystery, and with round eyes that had a frightened
look in them. He closed the door, and carefully removed
his dingy skull cap; combed out the last
threads of its silk tassel between his fingers; and
looked up and spoke.</p>

<p>"Mr. Byfield, sir," he whispered&mdash;"my daughter
is ill."</p>

<p>Gilbert got up quickly, and came across to where
the little man was standing. "What do you mean?"
he demanded in a shocked voice.</p>

<p>"Fainted, sir&mdash;gave way suddenly, and became
all at once, in a manner of speaking, collapsed," said
Meggison, nodding at him slowly. "Never knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
her do it before&mdash;but it's not unlikely she may do
it again. Mr. Byfield, sir&mdash;my heart bleeds."</p>

<p>"She must be got away&mdash;at once," said Gilbert
hastily.</p>

<p>"She must be got away&mdash;at once," echoed Meggison,
moistening his lips with the tip of his tongue.
"Just what I said, Mr. Byfield, sir, as she was coming
to. Not a moment to be lost&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"Not an instant," said Gilbert, beginning to pace
up and down the room. "We've waited too long
already, Meggison, over that scheme of ours."</p>

<p>"Nearly a week&mdash;and nothing done," retorted
the other, twisting the skull cap round and shaking
his head at it. "Not my fault, of course."</p>

<p>"It's only because I haven't known what to do,
or how to do it," said Gilbert, pondering. "But
now we must wait no longer; you must take her
away at once."</p>

<p>"At once," said Meggison, putting on his cap
with an air of determination, as though he had quite
made up his mind to start upon a journey forthwith.
"All times are alike to me, Mr. Byfield, sir;
it's only the question of money." His eyes were
expectant.</p>

<p>"It's just the question of money, Meggison, that
is troubling me," said Gilbert Byfield, seating himself
on the end of his desk, and so facing the little
man at the door with folded arms. "If it hadn't
been the question of money, and the difficulty of
dealing with it, and of dealing with you, something
would have been done before."</p>

<p>"Of dealing with me, Mr. Byfield, sir?" Daniel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
Meggison put his head on one side, with a faint show
of indignation.</p>

<p>"Frankly, Mr. Meggison, I do not know quite
what you would do with any substantial sum of
money that might be placed in your hands. I do
not trust your discretion. I want to speak quite
plainly."</p>

<p>"Don't spare my feelings," said Meggison, leaning
against the door, and folding his arms in turn.
"I have been battered by the world; I can put up
with anything."</p>

<p>"You clear the ground beautifully," said Gilbert,
smiling grimly. "Frankly then, I don't care a rush
about you or your son, or any of you&mdash;with the
sole exception of Bessie. I want to help her&mdash;and
I only use you because there's no one else that stands
in such near relation to her as you do. She wouldn't
take money from me&mdash;but you will; and so we've
got to start some little fiction about the matter, as
I suggested. This very night, Mr. Meggison, you
must come into your property; but I shall have to
be a sort of trustee, the better to keep a tight hand
upon what you do."</p>

<p>"You mentioned a sum of fifty pounds," said
Meggison, after an uncomfortable pause. "Fifty
pounds is not much, when it comes to a holiday; as
fortunes are counted, it's nothing to speak of."</p>

<p>"I've altered my mind about that," said Gilbert.
"Instead of providing the money, I think I'll provide
the place for a holiday, and see that you have
sufficient money to keep it going. I've a cottage in
Sussex&mdash;at a place they call Fiddler's Green; I've
used it for fishing and so forth; it's rather pretty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
and it wouldn't be half a bad notion to whisk this girl
of yours away down there, and give her a holiday."</p>

<p>Daniel Meggison looked dubious. "It occurs to
me, on the other hand, Mr. Byfield, sir," he said, with
a shake of the head, "that she might find it dull.
No society&mdash;no familiar figures such as she meets
every day; no intercourse with boon companions&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Perhaps you're thinking a little of yourself,"
said Gilbert, with a smile. "I imagine we can trust
your daughter to like the place to which I'm thinking
of sending her. We'll call it settled. Now for
the method."</p>

<p>"Which I suppose is where I come in," retorted
the other, a little sourly.</p>

<p>"Exactly. We want a fine stretch of your imagination;
we want you to invent that mysterious relative,
or that extraordinary speculation&mdash;either of
which shall in a moment provide you with a substantial
sum of money. What more natural, therefore,
than that you&mdash;devoted father&mdash;should immediately
turn to your daughter with the earnest
desire that she should be the first to benefit by your
good fortune. The cottage at Fiddler's Green you
rent, as a surprise to her; you give her the rest
she so sorely needs; you bring her back to London
in due course, with renewed strength to take up the
battle of life."</p>

<p>"Back to Arcadia Street? It seems rather a tame
ending, Mr. Byfield, sir," said the little man, with a
shake of the head.</p>

<p>"It's the ending we'll adopt for the present,"
retorted the younger man. "And you understand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
of course, that I must not appear in the matter; I
shall be as greatly surprised as she will be to hear
of what has happened. Remember always that she
believes me to be almost as poor and as struggling
as herself."</p>

<p>"It's all right up to a point," said Meggison,
pursing up his lips and frowning; "what I don't
like is the temporary nature of it. Come, sir&mdash;don't
be cheese-paring; why not do the thing more handsomely&mdash;extend
it a bit&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"All I intend to do is to give Bessie a short holiday
at Fiddler's Green, and to bring her back to
London restored to health," said Gilbert, with an air
of finality.</p>

<p>"Well of course, Mr. Byfield, sir, you know best,"
Meggison said doubtfully. "In the meantime I
will go and see my child, and will endeavour to act
my part in that game of make-believe as becomes a
father and a man. If by any chance you should
be walking in the garden attached to this house a little
later on, it might happen that Bessie would have
some startling news to impart to you. Splendid
notion&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>With restored good humour Daniel Meggison set
the old skull cap rakishly at one side of his head,
and went downstairs, whistling softly to himself,
and seeing before him a golden vision that was not
soon to fade.</p>

<p>A visit to the Arcadia Arms gave him renewed
confidence; through the glass he held he saw, by
no means darkly, a rosy prospect wherein Gilbert
Byfield continued from a mere matter of sentiment
to supply the wants of Daniel Meggison, at least,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
for the rest of that gentleman's natural life. Daniel
told himself, if not in so many words at least with
so many nods and winks, that he would be a very
limpet&mdash;sticking fast to his benefactor, and not
to be shaken off. This young man had talked lightly
of fifty pounds&mdash;had spoken of them, in fact, in
much the same fashion in which Daniel Meggison
might have spoken of fifty pence. Over a second
glass Mr. Meggison said that this sort of thing
should be encouraged; that men of sentiment were
rare, and that for his dear daughter's sake at least
the chance should be snatched at. With the draining
of that glass Mr. Daniel Meggison had firmly
persuaded himself that it was his solemn duty to
sink his own personal feelings for the sake of his
child, and to make war upon this young man. Not
too steadily he went down Arcadia Street with that
idea in his mind.</p>

<p>Bessie had recovered, and was leaning upon the
sympathetic Amelia, inclined to laugh a little at this
new weakness that had come upon her. Her brother
Aubrey stood looking at her in some dismay, with
his hands thrust in his pockets, and with the inevitable
cigarette drooping from his lips; for this was
a new and uncommon disaster, which threatened the
source of his income. Not that he put it quite in
that crude fashion, but rather that he saw his small
world shaken to its foundations, and trembled a little
in consequence.</p>

<p>Mr. Daniel Meggison was jocose. He wondered
if by any chance Bessie (always his favourite child!)
was strong enough to bear a shock&mdash;to hear news
that might prove startling? Bessie a little faintly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
declared that she was quite well&mdash;was sorry, in
fact, to have caused such trouble; she was ready for
any news. Perhaps he had heard of a new and profitable
lodger?</p>

<p>"To the devil with all lodgers!" exclaimed Mr.
Meggison, with a sudden blustering violence. "We
have done with lodgers for ever, my child; henceforth
this particular Englishman's house is his castle&mdash;inviolate.
Henceforth his child plays the lady,
and takes that position in the world to which, as her
father's child, she has a right."</p>

<p>"You've stayed a bit long at the club, guv'nor,"
said Aubrey, applying a light to his cigarette and
winking at his sister. "'Tisn't quite fair to worry
Bess now&mdash;is it?"</p>

<p>"Be silent, sir!" Daniel Meggison turned upon
him wrathfully. "What do you understand of my
methods&mdash;or even of me? While you, sir&mdash;a mere
hobbledehoy&mdash;a lout&mdash;a frequenter of low billiard
saloons and such-like places&mdash;while you are
wasting your time and your substance in a species
of debauchery&mdash;your father is out and about in the
world&mdash;looking here and there and everywhere for
opportunities. While you are wasting the hard earnings
of your sister, and squandering money to which
you have no right, I am turning that brain which
has never really failed me yet to account&mdash;and
making money!"</p>

<p>By this time Daniel Meggison had worked himself
into that state of mind in which he was quite prepared
to believe that he really had done the wonderful
thing he suggested. He soared in imagination
in high finance; dabbled with this and with that;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
held the great world of money in the mere hollow of
his hand. For the first time in his mean and shiftless
life he had his grip upon a man who was prepared
to pay largely and without question; and
the education Daniel Meggison had received in a
hard world had prepared him to meet such a man,
and to deal with him in the right way. The more
he talked the more his ideas grew, and the more certain
he was that he had tapped at last a gold mine.
Moreover, on this occasion he knew that he had
played a stronger card than any he had ever held
before; his glance shifted to the figure of the girl,
and he recognized that her white face had a power
to charm gold out of the pockets of Mr. Gilbert
Byfield, and that in her very innocence as to the
plot lay Meggison's real safety.</p>

<p>"You are excited, father dear," said Bessie, going
to him with the intention to put him in his chair.
But he boisterously put an arm about her, and stood
thus in an attitude, facing the astonished Amelia
and the contemptuous Aubrey.</p>

<p>"Excited! I should think so, indeed," he exclaimed.
"Who would not be excited at the prospect
of a sudden fortune&mdash;of an end to want and
pinching and&mdash;and general meanness? Who would
not be excited at the prospect of leaping, in one
glorious moment, from Arcadia Street to affluence;
of stepping in a moment gloriously out of the shadows
in which for so long we have been plunged, into
the splendid sunshine of riches and plenty? Excited!&mdash;I
am drunk with excitement!"</p>

<p>"When you feel yourself fairly sober again, it
mightn't be a bad idea to let us know what on earth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
you are talkin' about," suggested Aubrey, leaning
against the mantelpiece, and presenting a bored expression
to the company. "Not that I'm denyin',
mind you, that you'd do a lot if you had the chance;
you've always impressed that on us, so that we ain't
likely to forget it. But what I argue is&mdash;show us
something solid."</p>

<p>Mr. Daniel Meggison laughed an easy laugh.
"Something solid, sir," he ejaculated. "What if
I tell you that I can to-night produce, if necessary,
a sum of fifty pounds&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Father!" The girl was clinging to his arm,
looking at him in bewilderment.</p>

<p>"What if I tell you that that is but the beginning&mdash;the
forerunner of many similar sums? Yes,
my child, your father has at last justified an existence
that has in the past not perhaps been all that
it might have been. For the future, my dear Bessie,
I will make amends; for the future our relative
positions will be changed. No longer shall you
trouble about lodgers&mdash;no longer shall you weigh
this and that, or reckon how much a shilling will do
in this direction or in that; all that is done with.
We have for the first time in our lives that very
necessary thing&mdash;an income."</p>

<p>"But, father, I don't understand," she pleaded.
"What has happened? It's only some dream&mdash;something
that in your good heart you wish might
come true&mdash;for my sake."</p>

<p>"I tell you it <i>has</i> come true!" he exclaimed.
"The chance of a lifetime&mdash;a mere matter of fortunate
speculation."</p>

<p>"Fortunate what?" demanded Aubrey contemptuously.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
"Where did you get the money to speculate?"</p>

<p>"Borrowed capital," replied Meggison promptly.
"What do you know of such matters? I hear of a
great many things in the world&mdash;stocks and shares&mdash;this
going up&mdash;that going down. It might have
happened that I had plunged the family deeper into
ruin even than before; that was a risk I had to take.
But no"&mdash;he shook his head, and smiled with deep
wisdom&mdash;"I knew from the beginning that I was
right. A pound or two in the right direction&mdash;and
a pound or two added to that. It mounted;
it grew into a perfect snowball, which, rolling on,
added to itself with every movement. So that to-night
I stand before you revealed in my true colours.
To all intents and purposes I am a rich man!"</p>

<p>She broke down then for the first time. It never
occurred to her for a moment to doubt him; indeed
she had always been secretly a little proud of this
man, who was a little better, in the matter of dignity
and deportment, than his fellows of Arcadia Street.
Her life had at all times been a surprising thing of
chances; this greater chance that had come was only
what might in her dreams have been expected. Practical
only in the matter of dealing with the small
details of her daily life, she was utterly unpractical
where it came to any question of dealing with the
world. This was but a coming true of all the best
dreams she had ever had.</p>

<p>She called him her dear, dear father; she blessed
and praised him for his cleverness; she called the
astonished Aubrey to witness that she had said over
and over again that if only father had his chance he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
would do better than anyone. They were not to
mind her tears; she had perhaps been a little tired
and a little troubled at times; but all that was done
with now, and they should see her bright and smiling.
Above all, they had never had any real chance
to show the best that was in them in the life that
was done with from to-night!</p>

<p>Mr. Aubrey Meggison was a little stunned. Feeling
that perhaps it might be well if he ranged himself
on the side of this new financier, he somewhat
flabbily shook the hand of his parent, and murmured
"Good old guv'nor!" as an encouragement to that
gentleman to do even better yet. And then in a
bewildered way, with Amelia the servant almost light-headed
from sheer excitement, they sat down to a
hastily provided supper, the better to discuss details.</p>

<p>"Of course you will understand that I have kept
it all secret; I intended to spring a surprise upon
you," said Daniel Meggison, between bites at an
unaccustomed delicacy. "And I have done nothing
by halves; in fact, I may tell you that I have already
provided a place in the country&mdash;a mere
modest cottage. Charming spot&mdash;Fiddler's Green,
Sussex," he added carelessly, with a secret determination
to discover from Gilbert exactly in what
part of Sussex Fiddler's Green was situated.</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear!" whispered Bessie under her
breath, as she looked at this new wonder. "The
country&mdash;and a cottage! Is it a large cottage,
father dear?"</p>

<p>"Largish," said Mr. Meggison cautiously.
"Roomy place&mdash;and well furnished. Fishing, I
understand, and other pursuits of a like nature."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will say that for the guv'nor&mdash;he has got
large ideas," said Aubrey, with a solemn nod. "I
wish he'd taken me into his confidence as to the
locality&mdash;but still I'm not blaming him for that.
Can't say I care much for the country <i>as</i> country&mdash;but
I dare say I shall get used to it. Rummy
thing, though, that you should have kept the game
going so well that you haven't even added to your
wardrobe, or changed your habits at all. He's a
sly 'un, the guv'nor," added the young gentleman,
with a wink at Bessie.</p>

<p>"I intended that it should all be a surprise;
moreover, I intended to assert myself, and to take
for the first time my true position in the family,"
said Mr. Meggison. "In this matter you will have
to take your time from me; when I say 'move,' we
will move. Now, as I am perhaps a little excited,
I will just stretch my legs in the open air, and perhaps
look in at my club for a moment or two."</p>

<p>By that time the man had fully persuaded himself
that all he said was true&mdash;had fully made up his
mind, in fact, that the great game on which he was
embarked could be played out to the end by sheer
bluff and cunning. Someone else was to pay the
piper, but Mr. Daniel Meggison had quite made up
his mind that he would call the tune. And so elated
was he that he even unbent so far as to desire Aubrey
to join him in that stroll to the Arcadia Arms;
so that father and son went off arm in arm, with
quite a new amiability sitting a little awkwardly
upon them.</p>

<p>Meanwhile there was, of course, one person to
whom it was absolutely necessary that the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
news should be told&mdash;one person who would be glad
for her sake, and yet, she hoped, a little sorry on
his own account. She went out into that garden
of her dreams, feeling a little strange now that the
dreams were coming true&mdash;vaguely troubled in
fact that there should be no more necessity for
pretence. She was like a child that is promised with
certainty a new and gorgeous toy, and yet looks
back, in the very act of going to it, with regret at
the broken, battered things left behind.</p>

<p>Not that the place seemed poor or common; it
could never be that, because of the memories it held.
Nor did it look shabby even to-night, with the
grander prospect opening out in Bessie's imagination;
she would be in a sense regretful at the thought
of leaving it, because so much had happened there&mdash;every
poor sordid stick and stone of it meant so
much more to her than to anyone else. She passed
through the place now smilingly, looking and listening
for her friend.</p>

<p>And the friend was there; in the strangest fashion
he looked over the wall directly she emerged from
the house. Of course he knew nothing of the great
and glorious news; that was for her to tell him.
Pride was in that thought, because all in a moment
she was lifted nearer to him by reason of her new
riches. She was greater even than this wonderful
young man who could spend money recklessly on
theatres and cabs. She went straight to him now,
and told him without parley all the great news.
He, expecting it, set himself to appear as surprised
as she would expect to find him.</p>

<p>"Mr. Byfield&mdash;there's something I want to tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
you," she began. "You've been my best friend&mdash;almost
my only friend; so you must know before
anyone else. It's great good news."</p>

<p>"I'm very glad," he assured her, leaning on the
wall, and looking down at her. "What has happened?
Another and a splendid lodger?"</p>

<p>She laughed and shook her head&mdash;laughed more
light-heartedly than he had ever known her. "It's
nothing to do with lodgers; there are never going
to be any lodgers any more," she said; and he
thought how even the tired voice had changed in
a little time. "Father has suddenly grown very
rich!"</p>

<p>He stared at her for a moment in utter bewilderment;
he could not understand. He was on the very
point of correcting her, and of telling her that the
strange fortune which had come to her father was
a matter that would provide leisure for a period
of a few weeks only, when he reflected that he must
know nothing about it. Doubtless she had misunderstood
old Meggison; that would be a matter to be
set right afterwards.</p>

<p>"I'm very glad," he said cordially. "Very rich&mdash;is
he? And what's he going to do with all his
money?"</p>

<p>"He thought first of me; one might know he
would do that," she said proudly. "He's taken a
house in the country&mdash;and he's going to take me
down there&mdash;and of course Aubrey."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;so Aubrey's going&mdash;is he?" said Gilbert
slowly. "Anybody else?"</p>

<p>"I was only thinking, Mr. Byfield," she said
shyly&mdash;"I was only thinking that we should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
glad if you would come down. I know father would
like it&mdash;and so should I. It's at Fiddler's Green."</p>

<p>"I shall be delighted," he exclaimed, smiling at
the thought of this strange invitation to his own
place. "And I suppose you're going to stop there
until you're quite well and strong again&mdash;eh?
You'll be sorry to come back to Arcadia Street."</p>

<p>"But we're not coming back to Arcadia Street,"
she assured him. "Father's going to give it all up;
we're going to live down there for ever. Think of
it&mdash;in the country!"</p>

<p>The friendly darkness hid his bewildered face; he
wondered what new blunder Daniel Meggison had
plunged them all into. Even as that thought came
to him the door at the end of the garden was opened,
and old Meggison came in. He was singing to himself
in a high cracked falsetto, and the hand that was
not required to support him against the edge of the
door was solemnly beating time to the tune. He
closed the door, and leant against it; stared with
drunken sternness at his daughter.</p>

<p>"Whash this?" he demanded. "Go in, m' child;
go t' bed. Object mos' strongly&mdash;endanger precious
life. Go t' bed!"</p>

<p>Bessie went in quickly, and her father, after a
preliminary stagger, essayed to follow her. He was
pulled up quickly by the stern hurried voice of Gilbert
Byfield.</p>

<p>"What have you been telling her?" demanded the
young man.</p>

<p>Mr. Meggison winked solemnly. "A little exaggel-exaggeration,"
he replied. "Splendid notion!
Goo' night!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />

<small>FAREWELL TO ARCADIA STREET</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>THE morning which followed that night of wild
exaggerations found Mr. Daniel Meggison in
a despairing mood. He knew that he had gone too
far&mdash;understood that he had plunged not only himself
but others into this new sea of deceit in which
they must all struggle together, and from which only
one hand&mdash;that of Mr. Gilbert Byfield&mdash;could
drag them. In the calmer mood following upon a
severe headache, and a petulant remembrance of certain
absurd statements of the night before, Meggison
saw that he must substantiate much of what had
been said at the earliest possible opportunity. Bessie
believed in him, and Bessie would require to be
satisfied; if even that considerable sum of fifty
pounds was to be wrung out of the matter, the game
must be kept alive, for a few days at least.</p>

<p>In a sense, however, Bessie had taken the matter
out of his hands. Her belief in him was so sublime
and so fine that she had absolutely taken him at his
word; and that morning the one or two lodgers who
only paid when they were driven to it, and the one
or two others who paid when by chance they had
any money, had special interviews with a radiant
girl in a shabby black frock, who told them with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
shining eyes that she was sorry to get rid of them,
and that the bills did not matter. The house was to
be given up; they were retiring to the country. So
the lodgers went away puzzled, thereafter to make
arrangements for other lodgings, where it was to be
feared they might not find landladies who would deal
with them so generously.</p>

<p>Two lodgers were difficult to deal with: poor
Harry Dorricott for one, and Simon Quarle for another.
It was hard to turn Harry out into the
world&mdash;harder still to make him understand that
in one night his divinity had been removed far out
of his reach. He did not understand in the least;
he pleaded that he might have the new address, so
that in time to come he could forward his long overdue
account. For the rest, she cut short as delicately
as she could his farewells and his protestations.</p>

<p>It was not so easy to get rid of Mr. Simon Quarle.
Mr. Simon Quarle usually breakfasted late, because
there was no business which claimed him, as in the
case of the others; and this morning Bessie came
upon him with a newspaper propped up against the
cruet, and with a fork busily going over a breakfast
that had been already cut up for greater expedition
in eating. He looked up at her quickly as she came
into the room, and then frowningly resumed his
breakfast and his newspaper; which was in a sense
his habit.</p>

<p>"If you please, Mr. Quarle&mdash;if I might speak
to you," she began.</p>

<p>"Which is exactly what you're doing, you know,"
he retorted, not unkindly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>"I thought I should like to know when it would
be suitable to you to go, Mr. Quarle."</p>

<p>He laid down his fork very slowly, and looked up
at her; picked up the fork again, and resumed his
breakfast. "Don't talk nonsense, Bessie," he said.</p>

<p>"But, indeed, Mr. Quarle, I mean it," she urged.
"The house is going to be sold up&mdash;and all the
lodgers are going. Of course I'm very sorry&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And pray what's the execution for this time?"
he demanded, laying down his fork finally with a
sigh, and leaning back in his chair. "And how much
is it?"</p>

<p>"You won't understand," she exclaimed, taking
a seat at the further side of the table, and resting
her chin on her folded hands, and smiling across at
him. "You've been so very good to me always, Mr.
Quarle, that I thought you'd be glad."</p>

<p>"Glad! Because once again you're in difficulties?"</p>

<p>"But we're not; it's quite the other way about,"
she exclaimed. "We're only getting rid of this
place&mdash;and the lodgers&mdash;and you&mdash;because
father has come into a lot of money, and is taking
me down into the country."</p>

<p>"Your father has come into a lot of money?"
The man burst into a laugh, and picked up his fork
again. "Who's told him so?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Quarle&mdash;you are really most unkind," she
said. "Father is much more clever than anyone has
ever imagined; he has speculated and made money,
while we have all thought that he has merely been
living the life of a&mdash;a gentleman&mdash;and doing
nothing. Ask him yourself if you're not sure."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will," said Quarle grimly.</p>

<p>"And will you please tell me when it will be convenient
for you to go?" she asked again. "Oh,
please don't think that I'm anxious to get rid of you;
I'd like to keep you here for ever and ever; but
of course I have to remember that things are so different&mdash;and
that father and Aubrey must be considered.
I'm sure you understand that."</p>

<p>Simon Quarle slowly laid down his fork for the last
time, and pushed his plate away from him. "Come
here," he said gruffly.</p>

<p>She got up, and came round the table, and stood
close to him; he took one of the hands that was a
little coarsened with work, and gently held it while
he spoke to her; and his voice was altogether
changed.</p>

<p>"When I came here first you were a bit of a girl
in short frocks&mdash;shorter even than they are now&mdash;and
I was sorry for you. I could have gone to
other lodgings&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm glad you didn't, Mr. Quarle," she whispered.</p>

<p>"But I didn't. I came here because I liked the
look of you, and I thought my bit of money might
be useful. There was no woman in the world that
was anything to me&mdash;and I had no chicks&mdash;no
one who cared a button about me. I saw you grow
up&mdash;and you didn't grow up half badly; and I
suppose because I'm an old fool, I'm fond of you."</p>

<p>"I know," she said softly.</p>

<p>"Consequently, I don't want any tricks to be
played, or any infernal nonsense to come into your
life and to upset it. I'm not going to say anything
about family matters, because I suppose after all a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
father's a father, no matter what color he is. Only
I'm a business man, little Bessie, and we must know
that everything is fair and square and straight. Do
you understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course I understand; only I think none
of us quite know what father is capable of," she
responded.</p>

<p>"There I agree with you," he retorted grimly.
"And I'll talk about going when I've had a chance
to inquire into the matter. Don't turn me out before
it's necessary; it happens that I'm rather a
lonely man."</p>

<p>"You'll be able to come down and see us as often
as you like&mdash;to stay with us," she reminded him;
but to that he made no answer.</p>

<p>That arch-plotter Daniel Meggison had been spending
an anxious hour or two in search of his patron.
Inquiry at the front of the house next door elicited
the information that Mr. Gilbert Byfield was having
his bath; the landlady a little contemptuous concerning
a man who found it necessary to wash all over
every day. An impromptu peep over the wall at the
back was equally useless. The only occupation left
to Daniel Meggison was to saunter about the house,
and to carry things with a high hand, and yet with
a failing courage.</p>

<p>His man might escape at any moment, and go
out into that world outside Arcadia Street, and
never come back. The people with whom hitherto
Daniel had had dealings were in the habit of repudiating
a promise at a day or even an hour's notice;
it was quite on the cards that this young man would
do the same. Daniel Meggison began to wish that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
he had in some fashion got the thing reduced to
writing; more than that, he began to doubt the
actual value of that asset on which he had counted&mdash;his
daughter. Therefore Simon Quarle, coming
upon him unexpectedly, and thrusting his head out
at him in characteristic fashion, found the man in
no mood for questions.</p>

<p>"It's all right," said Meggison, with a very distinct
air of its being all wrong. "I have been lucky&mdash;fortunate;
I have kept my eyes open."</p>

<p>"How much have you made?" demanded Quarle
stolidly. "Always better to come to figures, you
know."</p>

<p>"It doesn't concern you&mdash;and I am inclined to
keep my particular figures to myself," snapped
Daniel Meggison. "Suffice it that this system of
living is ceasing; suffice it that I no longer find it
necessary to depend for my income upon lodgers
whose payments are not what they should be, and
whose manners do not please me."</p>

<p>"Keep your temper, Meggison; there's nothing
that should call for personal remarks. If you didn't
like my manners you could have got rid of me years
ago&mdash;always supposing, of course, that it suited
me to go. Meantime, we're no nearer to this mysterious
fortune&mdash;are we? Exactly in what particular
investments were you so very lucky?"</p>

<p>"The investments were&mdash;were various," said
Daniel Meggison, with a wave of the hand. "A
little bit in this&mdash;and a little bit in that; it's taken
quite a long time&mdash;but it's growing even now."</p>

<p>"Wonderful!" said Simon Quarle, nodding his
head slowly. "Most remarkable. And so you sell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
up everything here&mdash;and you start for the country&mdash;eh?
House cost much?"</p>

<p>"I have merely&mdash;merely rented it&mdash;hired it for
a period," said Meggison.</p>

<p>"What I shall do with you," said Quarle, with a
bullying shake of his head at him, "will be to keep
my eye on you. You've been doing something mysterious&mdash;something
you don't want talked about;
I shall find out presently what it is. You never were
any good, you know&mdash;and you never will be. Don't
wave your arms about, and don't splutter at me;
bluster is the last dog that will frighten me. So far
as you're concerned I don't care a snap of the fingers&mdash;but
I do care about the girl."</p>

<p>"Sir&mdash;you are not the only one who cares about
the girl," retorted Daniel Meggison. "It is for her
sake that I have done this; it is on her account alone
that I propose burying myself in the country, and
having what will probably prove a devilish dull time
of it. I decline to answer any further questions; it
is no affair of yours."</p>

<p>He went away again on that hunt for Byfield;
with the creeping on of the hours his courage had
fallen more and more. He had burnt his boats, in
the sense that even his daughter now was ranged
against him in that mad business of giving up what
had, at the best and the worst, been a livelihood for
them all. He had hoped that she would have been
content to take her cue from him, and to march a
little behind his stride; he was appalled, now that he
came to look at the thing from a common-sense point
of view, to see that she was bringing to bear upon this
new situation the characteristic energy that had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
helped her in the old one. He had forced her to be
self-reliant in the past; that self-reliance now might
well prove the undoing of them all.</p>

<p>He was returning from a hurried visit to the Arcadia
Arms when he met Gilbert Byfield in the street.
He essayed a rather nervous "Good morning, Mr.
Byfield, sir"; but it halted on his tongue as Byfield
frowningly took him by the arm, and turned
him round, and walked with him up the street. Without
a word that young man conducted him to the
door of that house in which he had taken a lodging;
took him upstairs; and having got him into the
room where the desk littered with papers stood,
thrust him unceremoniously into a chair, and looked
at him sternly over folded arms.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Daniel Meggison&mdash;let me know what
the game is," said Gilbert.</p>

<p>"Game, Mr. Byfield, sir?" asked Daniel innocently.
"I'm sure, so far as I'm concerned, there
ain't any game; if I've been a bit playful in mentioning
matters&mdash;a joke's a joke&mdash;and I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There is no joke about this, Meggison," broke
in Gilbert. "I want you to understand from the
beginning that this is to be merely a holiday for the
girl; whatever innocent lie you tell must not go
beyond that. My cottage at Fiddler's Green is at
your disposal for a few weeks; and that will be the
end of it."</p>

<p>"Have I said different?" pleaded Daniel passionately.
"A bit of money was what I've come into,
and no more than that. I'll own that last night, Mr.
Byfield, sir, I was excited&mdash;exhilarated&mdash;perhaps
a little unduly happy. Mine has been a hard life, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
if I may be said to have looked upon the rosy wine
in a joyful moment, is that always to be thrown up
in my face for ever after? Is there to be no charity
extended to me?"</p>

<p>"Last night you led your daughter to believe that
this was no mere matter of a little sudden money to
provide her with a holiday&mdash;but something in the
nature of a fortune, that should mean ease and contentment
for the rest of her days."</p>

<p>"A playful exaggeration; she perfectly understands
this morning," said Daniel. "She knows her
poor old father; she will take the thing in the right
spirit, and be grateful. I am a man of imagination,
Mr. Byfield, sir; I can assure you that a very ordinary
duck with me may quite easily and legitimately
become a swan."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;so that you have explained it, I suppose
it's all right," said Byfield slowly. "Only for her
sake you must be careful."</p>

<p>"Careful, Mr. Byfield, sir?" exclaimed Daniel
fervently. "From this moment I will be more than
discreet. I was careless last night&mdash;reckless&mdash;unpardonably
reckless. It shall not occur again; I'm
annoyed with myself."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;we'll say no more about it," said Gilbert,
a little sorry and ashamed that he should have been
so hard on anyone so abject. "Get her away to
Fiddler's Green as soon as possible; I'll arrange that
the house shall be ready, and that servants shall be
there to look after you. There's a housekeeper and
others there, and they shall be instructed that for
the time being you are master, and that they take
their orders from you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>"That will be highly satisfactory," said Daniel,
cheering up wonderfully at the thought of the new
importance that was to be his. "But if you will
pardon my suggesting such a thing&mdash;there is a little
matter of ready money&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, you shall have ready money," said Gilbert
impatiently. "There will be certain things to be
bought&mdash;certain expenses to be paid. I suggest
that you should be at Fiddler's Green for the next
month or six weeks. You will, I suppose, get someone
to look after the place&mdash;your own house I mean&mdash;in
your absence?"</p>

<p>"I can quite safely leave that to my daughter,"
said Daniel, with a sort of cold shudder going
through him at the remembrance of what had already
been done in regard to the house. "She will
provide for everything, as she has always done. A
most reliable good girl, Mr. Byfield, sir."</p>

<p>The little man was so quiet now, and so humble and
grateful, that Gilbert had no hesitation in sitting
down to write a cheque for a certain sum to meet
initial expenses. In the very act of writing it he
looked up, and spoke to the waiting Daniel Meggison;
he was petulantly anxious that his own point of view
should be understood.</p>

<p>"You will understand, of course, Meggison, that
I do this very willingly and very cheerfully&mdash;just
as I might do something to help some poor child that
could not help herself. For she <i>is</i> a child&mdash;isn't
she?"</p>

<p>"A mere babe, sir, in the ways of the world&mdash;a
toddler, who should never have left her mother's
knee," replied Meggison sentimentally. "Had she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
been, of course, anything else I should never for an
instant have consented to this." He was carefully
folding the cheque as he spoke, and was making
rapid calculations in his own mind.</p>

<p>"One other point, Meggison. It is possible that
your daughter might suspect that I had had something
to do with the matter; I believe she thinks that
I am a little richer than the people she generally
meets. Therefore to avoid that, I have made up my
mind to go away for a week, so that she may not in
any way connect me with what is being done. You
seem to have told your tale well&mdash;rather too well, if
anything&mdash;and she believes you; when you come
back here you will find me perhaps in this place again,
quite in the ordinary way. So far as money is concerned,
you will find your credit good at Fiddler's
Green, and my housekeeper will order what is necessary
for you. More than that, I will keep in touch
with you, and will let you have what other ready
money you may want. But no more talk of fortunes,
Meggison, if you please."</p>

<p>"Certainly not, Mr. Byfield, sir; that was an
indiscretion. I shall have a month or six weeks in
which to explain to Bessie that I cannot go on beyond
a certain time; she will understand perfectly.
As for your notion about going away&mdash;I applaud
it, sir. Splendid notion!"</p>

<p>"I'm glad you approve," said Gilbert dryly. "I
will write down here exactly what you're to do to
get to the house, so that you may in your daughter's
eyes appear to be already familiar with it; and
you will understand that to all intents and purposes
you will be master there so long as you are in it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
No one will question your right to be there&mdash;and
no one will interfere with you."</p>

<p>Thus it happened, in the little drama that was
afterwards to be played out so strangely, that Gilbert
Byfield, the better to preserve his secret, left his
lodging, and went back into the more seemly world
that knew him; while Daniel Meggison, knowing that
the coast was clear, set his hand boldly to the work
he had to do, and burnt what boats were left to him
with a gay good will.</p>

<p>The cheque was cashed; and from that moment,
with money in his pocket and apparently unlimited
credit for the first time in his life, Mr. Daniel Meggison
flung caution to the winds, and hurled himself
with zest into the new life that was opening before
him. Arcadia Street was shaken to its very foundations
at finding that the Meggisons were leaving&mdash;that
the Meggisons were arraying themselves in new
clothing, that the Meggisons had turned their lodgers
adrift, and that the Meggisons actually had
money to spend. Arcadia Street heard rumours, and
flung them further out into Islington, and even onward
into Highbury and other districts. If you
wanted a quick word for lucky or fortunate or anything
of that sort, you simply said, "What price
Meggison?" and clicked your tongue; and so became
in a moment wonderfully expressive.</p>

<p>Bessie, for her part, had set about the business, if
not exactly with caution, at least with some forethought.
The respectable part of the furniture
fetched a good price; a landlord who had long given
up hope compromised matters, and went away congratulating
himself on having got anything at all.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
Everyone suggested that the Meggisons might have
behaved better, but that on the other hand they might
have behaved worse. So that in the long run most
people were satisfied; while quite a number suggested
that, after all, if any luck was coming to Arcadia
Street, Mr. Meggison&mdash;always quite the gentleman,
mind you!&mdash;was the man who should properly
have it.</p>

<p>There came that tumultuous moment when the
bare and empty house was to be left, and when, with
such personal luggage as they had contrived to cram
into several very new trunks, they were about to set
out on their way to Fiddler's Green. Aubrey Meggison,
not desiring to be associated with so public a
departure, had casually suggested that he would
"turn up at the station"; Mr. Meggison had gone
out hurriedly, with a promise to be back in a moment;
the actual business of leaving was left to Bessie.
The small servant Amelia had drifted away hopelessly
back to that institution from which she had come,
there to wait until such time as another situation
should offer itself.</p>

<p>The cab was at the door, and the trunks were
piled upon it; and Arcadia Street had turned out to
see the great departure. All the children of Arcadia
Street had long since seized upon points of vantage,
and had taken up positions on the pavement, leaving
only a narrow lane, down which Bessie must presently
pass. The elders stood behind, and suggested
with sighs what they would have done if by any
chance Dame Fortune had swooped upon them. By
all accounts, it seemed unanimously resolved that they
would have made something of a "splash," though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
in what particular water they did not specify. And
while they waited, Bessie had gone through the blank
and empty house for a final look at it&mdash;and so out
into that poor garden of her dreams.</p>

<p>The garden was stripped now; the box that had
formed the ottoman was naked and broken; the
whole place a wilderness. Yet, as she stood in it for
a moment, she seemed to see it as it had been, and
as it never would be again; looked with eyes that
were bright with tears at the familiar shabby place.</p>

<p>"Good-bye&mdash;old garden!" she whispered. "You
did your best for me&mdash;but you never had a real
chance. Yet I have loved you as I shall never love
any other place, however beautiful; because everything
that was good and kind has happened to me
here. Good-bye; I hope someone may love you half
as well as I have done!"</p>

<p>So at last she fluttered out of the house, and into
the cab, with a kindly word or two for those that
pressed about her; and quite naturally, as it seemed,
told the man to stop at the corner&mdash;at the Arcadia
Arms. Someone raised a feeble cheer; and one man,
beating time, amazingly started&mdash;"For he's a jolly
good fellow"; then the cab rolled away, with the
younger part of Arcadia Street trailing after it.</p>

<p>Outside the Arcadia Arms it waited, with the girl
sitting quietly inside. It having been impressed upon
Mr. Daniel Meggison inside that he was wanted, and
that the time had come for farewells, he was presently
prevailed upon to emerge. He appeared surrounded
by friends, with a new silk hat, that had been
rubbed in places the wrong way, upon the back of
his head, and a large cigar with the band upon it in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
a corner of his mouth, and a little uncertain as to
what to do with his legs. He shook hands with all
and sundry, and murmured that he would never forget
them; was helped into the cab by a dozen willing
hands; and left to Arcadia Street the lasting remembrance
that they had seen him, as the cab drove
away, burst into tears.</p>

<p>Arcadia Street, having been shaken to its depths,
spent what was left of the day in discussing the matter,
and in talking about the Meggisons in general,
and Mr. Daniel Meggison in particular. And quite
late at night there were little knots of people gathered
outside the empty house, still talking of the
glory that had fallen upon those who had departed
from it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />

<small>THE PRINCE CUTS THE KNOT</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>A &nbsp;DULL week in that civilization to which he
obstinately refused to be accustomed brought
Gilbert Byfield back again&mdash;naturally, as it seemed&mdash;to
Arcadia Street. It had been a week spent practically
between three points of a compass which represented
Enid and her mother&mdash;the club&mdash;and his
rooms. A fourth point, of a smaller sort, was represented
by Mr. Jordan Tant, who hovered about
him anxiously, and wondered without disguise why
the man had ever come back at all.</p>

<p>Jordan Tant had made one or two remarks concerning
the strange little shabby girl of Arcadia
Street, but had found, something to his annoyance,
that Gilbert appeared to take no interest whatever
in that matter, and was quite indifferent to anything
that might be said concerning it. Tant groaned in
spirit at the thought that after all Gilbert had returned
to the ways of the world to which he belonged,
and that in due course Mr. Tant would be an interested
spectator at some such place as St. George's,
Hanover Square, what time Gilbert Byfield held the
willing Enid by the hand.</p>

<p>Yet, as has been said, within a week Gilbert disappeared
again&mdash;turning into Arcadia Street, appropriately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
dressed for it, late on a warm evening
just as the lamps were being lighted. He had kept
his rooms, paying for them some time in advance;
he put his key in the lock, and opened the door, and
went up. Lighting the gas in the shabby little place,
he saw that everything was just as he had left it,
and nodded slowly with satisfaction. While he was
still looking about him, his landlady bustled in to
give him welcome, and to ask if there was anything
he required. He told her that there was nothing he
wanted that night, and somewhat curtly dismissed
her when he saw that she was on the point of beginning
to relate some piece of news that was doubtless
of tremendous interest to her, if not to him. She
went away, and he was left alone.</p>

<p>Scarcely five minutes had elapsed when there came
a quick thud at the door, and it was opened unceremoniously
enough. Looking round frowningly, Gilbert
saw before him the thick-set figure of the man
Simon Quarle&mdash;that man who lived at the house next
door, and who had once thrust himself so unwarrantably
upon Gilbert in the garden. The man was hat-less,
and his strong almost scowling face was thrust
forward with its habitual bullying look.</p>

<p>"Good evening!" said Quarle abruptly, as he
closed the door.</p>

<p>"Good evening!" replied Gilbert, not very graciously.
"You wish to speak to me?"</p>

<p>"I do; I've come up for that purpose. At the
time I'm living just below you."</p>

<p>"In this house?" Gilbert stared at him in some
astonishment.</p>

<p>Simon Quarle nodded. "In this house," he said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
"I didn't want to go far when I left next door, and
I found that they had a couple of rooms vacant
here. Nothing like so comfortable&mdash;but it serves."</p>

<p>"But why have you left next door?" asked Gilbert,
after a pause.</p>

<p>"I left next door, if you wish to know, because
next door left me," retorted Quarle. "You've been
away, so I suppose you don't know. The Meggisons
have gone."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I know that; I understood that they
were going&mdash;into the country. But that's no reason
why you should leave, surely?"</p>

<p>"I can't very well live in an empty house with no
furniture," snapped Quarle, sitting down and rubbing
his hands slowly backwards and forwards on
his knees. "At least&mdash;I don't intend to, while there
are furnished rooms to be had."</p>

<p>"Empty house? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. no furniture? I'm afraid I
don't understand," said Gilbert slowly, and yet with
an uncomfortable feeling in his mind that he did
understand after all. "Will you please tell me
plainly what has happened to my little friend&mdash;our
little friend&mdash;Bessie?"</p>

<p>Simon Quarle stopped rubbing his knees for a
moment, and frowned. "I don't exactly know why
you should feel yourself privileged to call her 'Bessie';
I've known her longer than you have, and I'm
older than you are. However, that's neither here nor
there. The plain fact of it is that that arch tippler
and shuffler, Daniel Meggison, has suddenly come
into some money&mdash;or made some money&mdash;or stolen
some money. He boasts that for the rest of his natural
days he need not do any work (not that he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
ever done any to my knowledge before)&mdash;and that
he is going to live like a lord in the country&mdash;for
the sake of his daughter. The letting of lodgings
being quite out of the question for such a man in
such a position, the house and all the crazy furniture
has been sold up&mdash;and the family's gone."</p>

<p>Gilbert Byfield stood at his desk, looking down
at it, and fingering the papers upon it in an aimless
fashion. He saw clearly enough the position in which
he was placed; understood only too well that Mr.
Daniel Meggison had decided to play that great
game of make-believe in the grand manner, being
certain in his own mind that Gilbert Byfield would
hesitate to stop him. The pretty fiction which Gilbert
had himself invented must be kept alive until
such time as Daniel Meggison decided he had had
his fling, and was prepared to come back to the
sober things of life. That at least was Gilbert's
first thought.</p>

<p>"I suppose, Mr. Quarle, our friend Meggison did
not happen to mention to you what sum of money
he had secured&mdash;did he?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't get a word out of him as to that&mdash;nor
could I discover in what particular investments
he had been interesting himself," replied Simon
Quarle. "It struck me as somewhat peculiar that
a man of that type should suddenly come into money&mdash;by
his own judicious speculation. In other words,
Mr. Byfield, there's a mystery about it."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;at all events it doesn't concern me," said
Gilbert, a little coldly; for he was not inclined to
give his confidence to this abrupt bullying man who
had so unceremoniously invaded his rooms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>"No&mdash;of course not," retorted Quarle. "How
should it concern you? In a sense, you know, Mr.
Byfield," he went on, with a slyness that was ominous&mdash;"I'm
sorry for you. Things have been
taken out of your hands a little; you haven't been
able to do quite what you desired&mdash;have you?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I don't quite understand," said Gilbert,
turning over the few letters that were on his
table, and idly picking up one, the handwriting of
which was unfamiliar.</p>

<p>"The night I caught you trespassing you declared
to me that you wanted to help the girl&mdash;to do
something for her."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;and I didn't succeed. What then?"
Gilbert glanced up at him with an impatient frown.</p>

<p>"Very strange that it should happen that within
a matter of days of that time her father&mdash;penniless
ne'er-do-well&mdash;should suddenly come into money&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"A mere curious coincidence," responded the
other quietly. "You'll excuse me?" He indicated
the letter he held, and Simon Quarle nodded.</p>

<p>Gilbert ripped open the envelope, letting it fall
to the floor as he unfolded the letter. Mr. Simon
Quarle stooped forward politely and picked up the
envelope; let his eyes glance across it for a moment
as he laid it carefully on the desk. Then he sat with
his hands on his knees, and with his head thrust forward,
looking out of half-closed eyes at the man
who was reading the letter.</p>

<p>The letter was from Bessie. It was a grateful,
passionate, almost childish thing&mdash;written to a
friend who would understand her great new happiness;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
and as he read it the man's face relaxed into
a smile, and his heart softened. After all, the cost
was nothing, as compared with this fine fruit; the
game might go on for some time longer at least.
She was a child, with the heart and mind of a child
unspoiled; and it had been strangely given to him
to have the power of bringing her into a world where
for the first time she tasted joy&mdash;where for the
first time she appeared to be radiantly happy. Yes&mdash;the
cost was nothing.</p>

<p>His musings were cut short by the dry, hard voice
of Simon Quarle. "So she writes to you?" he said.</p>

<p>Gilbert looked round at him, visibly annoyed.
"How do you know that?" he demanded.</p>

<p>Simon Quarle pointed a finger at the envelope he
had placed on the desk. "I know the writing," he
replied. "The weekly bills used to be made out by
her; I've got dozens of 'em. Well&mdash;there's nothing
to be offended about; how's she getting on?"</p>

<p>There was a curious note of wistfulness&mdash;almost
a note of jealousy in the man's tones; he seemed to
rage at the thought that this other man could have a
letter from her that brought a softening smile to his
face, whilst he&mdash;that older friend Simon Quarle&mdash;sat
there empty-handed. The world was a bitter
place just then, and he resented its bitterness more
than usual.</p>

<p>"She's well&mdash;and she's very happy," said Gilbert
grudgingly.</p>

<p>"Anything about her dear father?"</p>

<p>"Father also appears to be very well&mdash;though
nothing is said about his particular happiness," replied
the younger man, with a glance at the letter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
"You will be interested also perhaps to learn that
Aubrey finds the country somewhat dull .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but
perhaps you're not interested in Aubrey?"</p>

<p>"I am not," replied Quarle. "I don't know that
I'm particularly interested in anyone except the girl."
He got up, and moved across the room, with his hands
clasped behind his back; stopped without looking
round, and put a question. "How long, Mr. Byfield,
does this precious fortune last?"</p>

<p>"How in the world should I know?" demanded
Gilbert, more savagely than he intended. "You'd
better ask Meggison; he knows all about it. And
may I suggest, Mr. Quarle, that I'm busy, and would
rather be alone?"</p>

<p>Simon Quarle turned slowly, and walked towards
the door; stopped there, and looked over his shoulder
back at Gilbert. "I'm sorry, Mr. Byfield," he said,
in a tone that was singularly gentle&mdash;"I'm sorry
that you find it necessary to remind me that I'm not
wanted; I'm more sorry still that you shut me out, not
only from your room but from your secrets. Good
night to you!"</p>

<p>"Stop!" cried Gilbert quickly, as the hand of the
other man was upon the door. "Come back, please;
let there be no misunderstanding about this. I have
not meant to offend you in any way; I did not mean
to be abrupt. But you must not connect me in any
way with this matter."</p>

<p>The other man came slowly back into the room, and
stood for a moment or two with his head bent, and his
hands clasped behind him, and the toe of one boot
grinding slowly into the carpet. Without looking up
he said at last&mdash;"I'm an older man than you are,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Byfield&mdash;and I know what a beastly world we live in,
from some points of view. Talk to me of Meggison
or his worthless son, and I don't care a snap of the
fingers; tell me about this girl, and the old blood in me
fires up as it might have done if it had ever been
ordained that I should have a child of my own.
That's foolish, I know&mdash;but for once it happens to
come straight from my heart. I have a love for her
that I have for nothing else on God's earth; and I
can't stand by now, and see her in all innocence rushing
on to a place where the feet of a stronger woman
might not tread. Do you or do you not understand
for one moment what you're doing?"</p>

<p>"I think so," said Gilbert quietly.</p>

<p>"I don't think you do. As I understand it, you've
cheated this girl&mdash;tried to draw her to you by a
beggarly underhand payment of pounds shillings and
pence. That's nothing to you, and you can keep it up
for a long time; but where's it going to end? Who's
going to tell her the truth&mdash;you or I?"</p>

<p>They faced each other in the shabby room&mdash;white-faced.
"What do you mean by the truth?"
asked Byfield at last.</p>

<p>"The truth&mdash;that your money buys the clothes
she wears and the food she eats; that every copper
she drops into the hand of a beggar is so much of
your money. Who is to tell her that?" Simon Quarle
did not flinch as he stood waiting for his answer.</p>

<p>"You put the thing crudely, Mr. Quarle," said
Gilbert at last. "I admit that on the face of it the
thing may be reduced to that; you have surprised
my secret, and you probably know as well as I do that
I am paying the small sum of money for this little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
whim&mdash;which pleases me and can do no harm to anyone
else. Stop&mdash;don't interrupt me; I repeat that it
can do no harm to anyone else, while on the other
hand it may do a great deal of good. The money is
nothing to me&mdash;what it can buy means a great deal
to her."</p>

<p>"But the end&mdash;the end of it!" persisted Quarle.
"What of that?"</p>

<p>"Let the end take care of itself," replied Gilbert.
"I would not have said so much as this to any other
man; but I do you the justice to believe that you are
honestly very fond of her, and that you would do a
great deal on your own account to help her. Therefore
I say that for the present the matter must be left
where it is."</p>

<p>"What was the original intention in your mind&mdash;apart
from merely helping her; what did you purpose
doing?" demanded Quarle.</p>

<p>"I planned a holiday for the girl&mdash;and God
knows she needed it badly. Our friend Meggison
probably&mdash;certainly misunderstood me."</p>

<p>"Exactly." Quarle nodded slowly, and grinned.
"It was the purpose of our friend Meggison to misunderstand
you," he said. "Meggison, for the first
time in his life, finds a rich man with a soft spot in his
heart; it is a chance not to be missed. He proceeds
to lie to everyone; to his daughter, who believes in
him completely&mdash;to others only too willing to believe
him. He displays some money; he has a house
in the country to which he is to go&mdash;&mdash; By the way&mdash;that
house in the country?"</p>

<p>"Is mine," said Gilbert. "I originally intended
that Meggison should take the girl down there for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
few weeks; that they should then return to their own
house. You know for yourself what he has done."</p>

<p>"The question is not so much what he has done as
what you are going to do," said the other. "The
bubble must burst some day, you know."</p>

<p>Gilbert Byfield picked up the letter again, and
looked at it attentively; turned to the other man, and
tapped the paper with a forefinger. "She's very well&mdash;and
very happy," he said slowly. "Think of that,
Quarle: for the first time in all her short life she is
very well and very happy. I say to you&mdash;to the
devil with your conventions and your laws&mdash;your
prejudices and what not; this child is happy. I think
you know in your heart that I shall do her no harm;
in mercy let her remain where she is, for a little time
at least, until I can decide what is to be done. Would
you drag her back here again to slave for that
drunken father and that lout of a brother; to face
semi-starvation, and bills and duns, and every other
sordid item that her life should never have known?
Would you do that, Quarle?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I would," replied the other stoutly.
"And keep her honest."</p>

<p>"She'll keep honest on her own account," said
Gilbert. "For the present, I tell you the thing must
remain as it is. Meggison won't speak, for his own
sake; you won't speak&mdash;unless you want to break
her heart."</p>

<p>"I'll promise nothing," said Quarle angrily. "You
think you've got me in a corner so that I can't move&mdash;but
I'll find a way to tell the truth without hurting
her&mdash;or if I do hurt her a little it'll only be for her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
good. Oh&mdash;I wish I could make you understand
what you're doing!"</p>

<p>"I tell you the thing was begun innocently
enough," replied Gilbert. "I'm not responsible for
what has happened&mdash;except that I ought to have
known what kind of man Meggison was, and so have
been prepared. For the present the thing must
stand&mdash;and you must be silent."</p>

<p>"It shan't stand an hour longer than I can prevent,"
was Simon Quarle's final declaration as he
went away.</p>

<p>Gilbert Byfield, reviewing the matter carefully so
far as it had gone, was disposed first to be righteously
indignant, and then to be amused. That which he
had done on the mere quick generous impulse of the
moment had suddenly turned into something so enormous,
and yet so cunningly devised, that he did not
quite see how he was to get out of it; on the other
hand, the sheer audacity of it held his unwilling
admiration even against his better judgment. At one
moment he told himself that he must honestly and
frankly declare what had happened, and must set himself
right in the eyes of the girl; the next he saw that
to do that would be to break down her self-respect
completely, and to strip old Daniel Meggison of whatever
virtues he possessed in the eyes of his daughter&mdash;both
clearly possible. Therefore, not knowing
what to do, he adopted what seemed to be the wisest
course&mdash;and did nothing at all.</p>

<p>Arcadia Street having grown distasteful, alike because
there was no Bessie Meggison next door, and
because the stern face of Mr. Simon Quarle fronted
him now and then on the staircase and in the street,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
he determined once more to go back to his own ordinary
mode of life, at least for a week or two; and so
came again in touch with Mr. Jordan Tant and the
rest. If he thought at all of what might be happening
at Fiddler's Green, he steadfastly strove to banish
the matter from his mind, and told himself that in that
he had succeeded. Nevertheless he was restless and
unhappy; and his spirit hovered, as it were, in waking
and sleeping moments alike, between Arcadia Street
and Fiddler's Green, Sussex.</p>

<p>A fortnight later found him back again in Arcadia
Street&mdash;there to discover another letter from Bessie,
gently suggesting that he might have found time to
write to her, and with a little general note of wistfulness
in it that tugged at his heartstrings. Almost he
determined to go down and see her; yet knew full well
that he dared not do that, for the simple reason that
he could not face those clear eyes and look into their
depths. At last he told himself that he would get to
work there in Arcadia Street, and would leave the
problem to work itself out.</p>

<p>Like most problems it was destined to work itself
out in a wholly unexpected fashion. It began to
work itself out the very next day, with the arrival of
Mr. Simon Quarle, who came in quickly, and closed the
door, and looked at Byfield with a face of gloom.
Gilbert waved his hand towards a chair to indicate
that this unceremonious guest should sit down.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I've been to Fiddler's Green," was
Quarle's first utterance, as he seated himself, and
squared his shoulders, and frowned at his host.</p>

<p>"You at Fiddler's Green? What for?"</p>

<p>"To see for myself what was going on; to understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
for myself how the Meggisons stand riches,"
said Quarle, evidently in a great state of grim
triumph. "I've seen them&mdash;talked with them&mdash;been
snubbed by one at least of them. Would you like to
hear about it?"</p>

<p>"How's the girl?&mdash;how's Bessie?" asked Gilbert.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;I grant you'd be pleased with her," retorted
Quarle grudgingly. "As pretty as a picture&mdash;and
with a smile in her eyes for the first time. But
the other two! The dogs&mdash;the scorpions&mdash;the
blood-suckers!"</p>

<p>"Steady! I'm sure there's nothing to get excited
about. What have they done to you?"</p>

<p>"I stand for nothing&mdash;and I don't complain," replied
Quarle. "But when I see that snivelling lounger
Daniel Meggison cutting a dash, sir, in a hired carriage&mdash;when
I see that ardent billiard-room enthusiast
Aubrey Meggison cutting an absurd figure
about the country lanes on a hired hack, and slapping
his leg with a riding whip in the bar of the local inn&mdash;when
I think of the bills that are running up, and
the price there'll be to pay&mdash;plus the necessary explanations&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That will do, thank you, Quarle," said Gilbert,
with a new gravity upon him. "I'll go down there at
once; I've delayed too long. I give you my word I
didn't think it was coming to this&mdash;I thought at
least they'd have the decency to be quiet."</p>

<p>"Decency, sir, is a word they don't understand.
Only I tell you I'm bitterly sorry for the girl. If I
could in any way drown father and son, or smother
them, or get rid of them somehow, I'd cheerfully do it,
if it would keep her in ignorance of the truth. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
word, Byfield: you've got to be mighty careful, because
either Daniel Meggison or the boy is mean
enough, if the game appears to be up, to tell the truth&mdash;and
not to tell it with too nice a tongue. Be
careful."</p>

<p>Gilbert Byfield had crossed the room and had taken
up a railway guide. There was a look of decision
about him that impressed Simon Quarle. While the
young man was busily fluttering the pages the door
was opened, and Mr. Jordan Tant sauntered in, as immaculate-looking
as ever. He glanced at the sturdy
figure of Simon Quarle, and then looked across at
Byfield; coughed to attract the latter's attention.</p>

<p>Gilbert turned and looked at him. "Hullo, Tant,"
he exclaimed. "I'm sure I'm very glad to see you.
Let me make you known to my friend&mdash;Mr. Simon
Quarle."</p>

<p>The two nodded distantly after the introduction,
and Tant stood awkwardly while Gilbert still fluttered
the pages. At last Gilbert flung the book aside
petulantly, and crossed over to his friend, and shook
hands with him.</p>

<p>"What's brought you to Arcadia Street?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Well, as a matter of fact, my dear Gilbert, I do
not come exactly on my own account, but for somebody
else," responded Mr. Tant. "Mrs. Ewart-Crane
wanted a message conveyed to you, and I couldn't
think of your number, although, as I told her, I knew
the house when once I got into this beastly locality.
Consequently, here I am."</p>

<p>"My friend Mr. Tant doesn't like Arcadia Street,"
said Gilbert, turning to Simon Quarle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>"The young gentleman doesn't look as if he did,"
retorted Quarle, with a curling lip.</p>

<p>"What I always say is, 'Let us draw the line,'"
said Mr. Tant severely. "However, my dear Gilbert,
the message is this. The old lady&mdash;(by which term,
of course, I refer not at all discourteously to Mrs.
Ewart-Crane)&mdash;the old lady is anxious to get away
into the country; thinks Enid is not looking well, and
so forth."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," said Gilbert absently. "But what
can I do?"</p>

<p>"There's that beautiful place of yours that you
leave empty so much&mdash;down at Fiddler's Green.
Now, if you could let her have that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I can't; it's quite out of the question," broke in
Gilbert harshly, with a glance at Simon Quarle.</p>

<p>"But, my dear Gilbert, she seems quite set on it,"
urged Mr. Tant. "There can be no reason&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The reason is, young gentleman, that the house is
full already," said Simon Quarle. "Full of people, I
mean."</p>

<p>"You must understand, Tant," said Gilbert, without
looking at him, "that I've lent the house to some
friends of mine&mdash;for a time. Tell Mrs. Ewart-Crane
that I'm sorry; under any other circumstances
I should have been delighted."</p>

<p>"Oh, very well, my dear Byfield," said Mr. Tant.
Then, as a thought occurred to him, he suggested
quickly&mdash;"Perhaps after your friends have left&mdash;gone
away from the house&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Byfield doesn't quite know when that's going
to happen," said Simon Quarle maliciously. "These
friends are down there as a sort of permanent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
arrangement&mdash;stop-as-long-as-they-like sort of
thing."</p>

<p>"You seem to know a great deal about it," replied
Tant, in his precise tones.</p>

<p>"I do; I've just been to see them," Simon Quarle
answered, with a grim laugh. "The sort of guests,
young gentleman, that you don't get rid of in a
hurry, I can assure you."</p>

<p>Gilbert plunged into the dangerous conversation
hurriedly. "I don't think anything more need be
said, Mr. Quarle," he exclaimed. "If you'll excuse
me now, there are things I want to talk to Mr. Tant
about. Good day to you!"</p>

<p>Simon Quarle got up, and walked to the door of
the room; turned there, and spoke with characteristic
bluntness. "Sorry if I've hurt anybody's feelings,"
he said. "Of course, it's no business of mine."</p>

<p>He was gone, and the two younger men faced each
other. It is safe to say that Jordan Tant had always
at the back of his mind one thought dominating all
others; the thought of Enid. The fact that Byfield
had gruffly refused even to consider the suggestion
that the house should be lent to her and her mother
set the man's wits to work; the fact that another man
who obviously lived in Arcadia Street knew all about
the strange occupants of that house at Fiddler's
Green stirred into being a process commonly known
as "putting two and two together." Mr. Jordan
Tant did some hard thinking.</p>

<p>"Please explain to Mrs. Ewart-Crane why I can't
let her have the house&mdash;and make my apologies!"
said Gilbert after a pause.</p>

<p>"I will certainly do that&mdash;when I know what to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
say," said Tant, putting his head on one side, and
looking at his friend with a smile. "My dear Gilbert&mdash;who
have you been giving away your property
to?"</p>

<p>"I have not been giving it away at all," retorted
Gilbert. "I've simply lent the house to some friends.
Say no more about it."</p>

<p>Mr. Jordan Tant said no more about it. After an
awkward pause he made a remark, which in the connection
was certainly startling. "By the way, Gilbert,
I noticed as I came into this house that your little
friend next door&mdash;the Princess, as you called her&mdash;has
flitted."</p>

<p>Byfield, startled, swung round upon him. "And
pray what the devil do you think that's got to do with
Fiddler's Green?" he demanded savagely.</p>

<p>Jordan Tant fairly leapt in his astonishment.
"Really&mdash;I never said&mdash;&mdash; Why, Gilbert&mdash;you
don't mean to say that you've sent her down to
Fiddler's Green?"</p>

<p>All this interference with what he had come to regard
as his private plans began to have a maddening
effect upon Gilbert Byfield. He had savagely to
acknowledge to himself that he had failed; that that
impulsive generosity of which he had been guilty had
been taken advantage of by those in whose hands
he was practically powerless. The thought of that
did not tend to mend his temper; and Tant was a
handy victim. Byfield squared his shoulders, and set
his hands on his hips, and gazed down at the shrinking
little man with blazing eyes.</p>

<p>"And suppose I have sent her to Fiddler's Green&mdash;and
suppose I intend to keep her there just as long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
as it pleases me&mdash;what then, my Tant?" he bellowed.
"What do you, in your secure and comfortable life,
hedged about by every conventionality, and not daring
to stir by so much as a hair's breadth from that
line you so often draw and so often talk about&mdash;what
do you know of the world and the people who
live in it? Can't a man stretch out the hand of
friendship to a woman without your smug lips opening,
and your smooth tongue beginning to bleat this
and that and the other? Must you always think that
we're in this world only to do wrong&mdash;that there are
no better impulses in any one of us? I'll tell you now
in so many words: the child of the white face and the
shabby frock is down at Fiddler's Green at my expense&mdash;and
she's having a holiday. Have you anything
to say to that?"</p>

<p>Jordan Tant backed away from him, and waved
him off with protesting hands. "My dear Byfield&mdash;I
have not said a word about it; it's not my business,"
he pleaded. "You have always been in the habit of
doing unconventional things, and I suppose you will
do them until the end of the chapter; but I am not
criticizing. It's very kind of you&mdash;very thoughtful&mdash;and
all that sort of thing. Necessarily one wonders
a little what the world will say&mdash;and one is a
little sorry for the girl, who is doubtless quite respectable&mdash;in
her own sphere of life&mdash;and quite
nice."</p>

<p>"I notice everyone's sorry for the girl," retorted
Gilbert, a little bitterly. "I think the girl can take
care of herself, and I think, even if it came to the
point where she understood the real truth of the matter,
she would come also to understand my motive."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I see; then she doesn't understand yet?" said
Tant slowly.</p>

<p>"How the devil could I tell her that I was going to
provide her with money&mdash;and a house&mdash;and various
comforts? You've no delicacy, Tant. No&mdash;I arranged
better than that; ostensibly her father is the
man who provides the money; he is supposed to have
come into a fortune unexpectedly. Now are you
satisfied?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly," said Jordan Tant, looking at the
floor. "It's all very simple&mdash;isn't it?"</p>

<p>Mr. Jordan Tant carried his amazed face out of
Arcadia Street, and back to the other end of London;
presented it in due course to Mrs. Ewart-Crane and to
Enid. Suffering himself to be questioned closely, he
refused to speak ill of a friend, but shook his head
over that friend nevertheless; and so had the thing
gradually screwed out of him.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't have you think for a moment that I'm
saying anything against poor old Byfield," said Tant
gloomily. "What I do think is that these designing
people have got hold of him, and that, to use a vulgar
phrase, they will bleed him pretty heavily unless someone
steps in. He's mad about the girl; but of course
he hasn't reckoned with the family. They'll stick to
him like leeches; he'll never be able to shake them off."</p>

<p>"My dear," said Mrs. Ewart-Crane, turning to her
daughter a determined face&mdash;"I think it is about
time that we interfered. Apart from every other consideration,
we owe a duty to a friend who, however
wrong-headed he may be, is at least a gentleman. I
shall most certainly step in, and shall understand once
for all, if only for my own satisfaction, what these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
people intend to do. I dare say a small cottage or at
the worst some rooms are to be obtained somewhere in
Fiddler's Green; we will go down, and see for ourselves
what is happening."</p>

<p>"Personally, mother, I don't think I should interfere,"
said Enid. "If Gilbert likes to be so silly it's
his affair, and it would be somewhat undignified on our
part to interfere."</p>

<p>"Undignified or not, I intend to do it," retorted
Mrs. Ewart-Crane. "Mr. Tant shall go down and
secure a place for us; if I don't have those people out
of Gilbert's house in something under a week, I shall
be very much surprised!"</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Gilbert Byfield had started himself for
the scene of operations. A telegram had flashed down,
addressed to Bessie; a telegram had flashed back
eagerly in reply; and here he was on his way to
Fiddler's Green. And all the thoughts he had tended
in one direction.</p>

<p>"I did it for the girl, and for her alone. Ask yourself,
Byfield, if there's anyone in the world like her;
ask yourself if you've ever met anyone cut out of the
living heart of life as she is; compare her with any
woman you have ever seen. Be strong, man; cut the
knot yourself, and get her out of the net in which
you're both involved. Think of her&mdash;and think of
yourself; nothing else matters."</p>

<p>His mind was pretty clearly made up as to what he
should do by the time the train drew in at the platform
at Fiddler's Green, and he was looking about to
see if by chance someone had come to meet him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />

<small>AND THE PRINCESS TIES IT AGAIN</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>DISAPPOINTMENT sat heavily on the face of
Gilbert Byfield as an obsequious porter who
knew him pulled open the door of the carriage and
seized his bag. For there was no one with a familiar
face in sight on the little platform; and Gilbert had
rather hoped that there might have been someone
with a smile to welcome him, and a hand to clasp his
own.</p>

<p>Few passengers ever get out at Fiddler's Green, and
on this occasion there was only a stout and heavy
farmer, and an elderly woman with a plethoric basket.
True, at the end of the platform was a young girl in
a white dress, and with a slim and pretty figure; but
young girls in white dresses were nothing to Gilbert
Byfield at that moment. He followed the porter
gloomily, muttering something to the effect that he
supposed he'd better have the fly.</p>

<p>It was only when he was actually giving up his
ticket that he found himself face to face with the girl
in the white dress; and then discovered that he was
holding her hands, and gazing at her&mdash;and that it
was Bessie, half laughing and half crying, and saying
again and again how glad she was to see him. And all
in a moment the sun was shining, and Fiddler's Green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
was beautiful; and the fly was a musty affair, good
enough to carry on his bag to the house, but not to be
ridden in under any circumstances.</p>

<p>They went on a little shyly and happily down the
long road that led from the station towards the house.
Once or twice she looked at him as he strode along
beside her; and she laughed with the conscious shyness
of a child, and yet with complete happiness.
Presently, when it came about that a turn of the road
hid them from the sight of the station or of any
houses beyond, she slipped her hand into his; and so
held it, as a child might have done, while they walked
on side by side. And then it was that the problem he
had to face loomed large, and asked fierce questions of
the man, and would not be denied. Questions hard to
answer, with that happy face beside him, and with
those clear eyes looking up into his own. He found
himself wishing passionately that the time might
never come when those eyes should change, or should
look at him with any indignation or any sorrow.
Which might well happen, as he knew.</p>

<p>"Tell me everything," he said after a pause.
"About your life&mdash;and what you do&mdash;and how you
spend your days. This is such a changed Bessie that
I scarcely seem to know her."</p>

<p>"For the better, Mr. Byfield?" She looked at him
with no seriousness at all, and he gave her a gay answer
naturally enough.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;this isn't the Bessie of Arcadia Street at
all; this is a being in a white frock who belongs
naturally and properly to the country. I shall believe
presently that you've been here all your life."</p>

<p>"I believe it already," she retorted. "Arcadia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
Street seems miles and miles away, as though it had
never existed at all; I find myself wondering sometimes
exactly how one turned into it&mdash;and what the houses
were like&mdash;and if they really were as small and mean
as they seem to be now. You'll like Fiddler's Green,"
she added quickly.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I shall. And so I suppose you are really
and truly very happy?"</p>

<p>She did not answer for a moment; she walked on
beside him, and he noticed as he glanced at her that
her face was grave. "So happy sometimes, Mr.
Byfield, that I'm afraid," she said steadily. "I wake
at night in the great room that is mine, and I lie listening
to the silence, and wondering if it's all true. I
dread sometimes to open my eyes in the morning, for
fear that I may open them in the old narrow room in
the old narrow house in Arcadia Street; I'm frightened
when they knock at my door in the morning, lest
it should be Amelia come to say that the baker has
stopped credit, or the milkman wants a little something
on account. You don't know, Mr. Byfield," she
added, turning wide, serious eyes upon him for a
moment&mdash;"you really don't know what it means
never by any chance to hear that phrase again&mdash;'someone
wants something on account.'"</p>

<p>"I think I can understand," he replied. "And
so you still like Fiddler's Green&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"I never believed that there was such a place," she
said. "It's wonderful! Even poor father seems to
be getting more used to it; he missed his club terribly
at first. But now he is finding quite a lot to interest
him; he drives round and studies the architecture of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
the various old inns round about&mdash;sometimes gives
up a day to it."</p>

<p>"And your brother?" asked Gilbert with a frown.</p>

<p>"Aubrey is turning out really splendidly," said the
girl. "He looks quite handsome when he's riding;
even father admits that&mdash;and father never did like
Aubrey. In fact, everything is better than it has ever
been&mdash;and all the dreams I ever had seem to have
come true."</p>

<p>"Dreams fade, little Make-Believe," he reminded
her.</p>

<p>"I don't think my dreams will ever fade," she replied.
"And you mustn't call me Little-Make-Believe
any more&mdash;because it isn't true. Everything is real;
I don't have to make-believe any longer."</p>

<p>"Fortunes are lost sometimes; it happens every
day," he urged again. "Suppose this great fortune
of yours was swept away&mdash;this fortune that came by
lucky speculation&mdash;what then?"</p>

<p>"I can't believe that it will ever end; I can't believe
that Fate would be so cruel as to send me back
again to Arcadia Street&mdash;and to all the old unhappy
life."</p>

<p>"You forget, Bessie; you were very happy there&mdash;playing
that great game of life."</p>

<p>She shook her head. "I didn't understand&mdash;that
was why I was happy," she said. "I struggled hard
to make myself happy&mdash;fought hard to reach every
little gleam of sunshine that came my way. Now I
don't have to fight; thanks to father, all my happiness
comes to me naturally."</p>

<p>They were nearing the house when she turned upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
him with astounding news. "Oh&mdash;I forgot to tell
you that we've got visitors."</p>

<p>"Visitors?" He stared at her as though not
understanding.</p>

<p>She nodded brightly. "Yes; Aunt Julia Stocker
and Uncle Ted. Father asked them down; father
said&mdash;'What's the use of having a big house if you
don't fill it?' Father's thinking of asking some other
people&mdash;friends of his particularly. Of course
there'll be lots of room for you, Mr. Byfield," she
added; "I've seen about your room myself. Besides
the housekeeper seemed to think that you'd like it; I
suppose she knew what sort of a man you were."</p>

<p>Gilbert Byfield went on to the house in silence,
listening as in a dream to the girl's animated chatter,
as she pointed out this, that or the other familiar
thing, and demanded his admiration. He began to
understand that the difficulties he had created were
greater than he had yet imagined; already he seemed
to see an imaginary Daniel Meggison&mdash;grinning and
triumphant&mdash;defying him to move at all, and sheltering
himself in every extravagance behind this girl
in the white frock, whose happiness Gilbert had purchased
at so strange a price.</p>

<p>Mr. Daniel Meggison, for his part, made no secret
from the beginning of the attitude he intended to
adopt. For some weeks now he had been given a free
hand, and that fact, combined with new clothes, and
a comfortable house, and money in his pocket, and
servants to do his bidding, had already gone far to
spoil the man, and to bring out some of the original
bully that had been suppressed in his nature. Whatever
qualms he may have felt he hid successfully at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
first moment of meeting. He stood at the door of the
house, with arms outstretched, and with a beaming
smile upon his face.</p>

<p>"Welcome, my dear Byfield&mdash;thrice welcome!" he
exclaimed, seizing Gilbert by the hand and wringing it
hard&mdash;as much in apparent cordiality as to impress
upon him that he understood the secret compact between
them, and was acting his part accordingly.
"Delighted to see you. I would have driven down
myself to the station&mdash;but my child here seemed to
think that you would expect her alone. Well&mdash;well&mdash;that
is quite natural; you were always good
friends. Come in, my dear Byfield&mdash;come in and
make yourself at home. You will find friends here;
stay as long as you like&mdash;do what you like&mdash;order
what you like! Come in!"</p>

<p>So Gilbert Byfield went into his own house, not
without some feeling of amusement, and looked about
him. The servant who hurried forward as he saw his
master was silenced with a look, and retired, wondering
more than ever; Gilbert allowed the girl to run on
before him up the stairs, to show him the way with
which he was already familiar. He expressed due
approval of the room (which happened to be his own),
and said that he felt he should be very comfortable
there for a few days.</p>

<p>When presently he went downstairs, his object was
to find Mr. Daniel Meggison and to have a talk with
that gentleman. But Daniel was not to be caught
napping; he avoided Gilbert on every occasion, and
clung to his relatives with an amazing fondness whenever
he saw the young man approaching him.</p>

<p>The relatives, for their part, adopted characteristic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
attitudes towards Byfield. Mrs. Stocker conceived it
to be her duty, being in the mansions of the great, to
sit in the largest and the stiffest chair she could
discover, in a condition of state, ready to receive all
and sundry. Her dignity in this particular instance
compelled her to suffer tortures, for the simple reason
that her husband, Mr. Edward Stocker, was free to
come and go as he liked, and was having rather a good
time. He cheerfully flitted about the place, and
smoked unaccustomed pipes in the boldest manner, and
was for once quite happy. Being introduced by
Bessie to the new-comer, he greeted Gilbert cordially.</p>

<p>"It's a wonderful world, sir," he exclaimed, looking
at Gilbert with a smiling face. "Now, it would never
have occurred to me that Meggison was the man to
make money&mdash;and yet to be so dark about it. Having
a little property myself&mdash;which runs to 'ouses&mdash;I
may say that I know what property is, and how
money is made. But Meggison seems to have gone a
cut above us all. A modest place down Clapham way&mdash;or
Brixton&mdash;or even Norwood&mdash;but when you
makes a splash in the country&mdash;with servants and
what not&mdash;&mdash;well, I can only say that it's a very
wonderful world, sir."</p>

<p>Gilbert left the little man, and, still in search of
Meggison, came presently into the presence of Mrs.
Stocker, sitting in state. She received him coldly, but
with the resignation of one who expects that all sorts
of people may drift in, and are not specially to be
accounted for. He was retiring again hastily, when
she recalled him.</p>

<p>"One moment, sir, I beg. One of my brother's new
friends?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, no&mdash;an old friend," stammered Gilbert.
"A friend of his daughter."</p>

<p>"She never told me&mdash;but that is not surprising;
I seem to learn everything only by accident here. I
should like to know, sir"&mdash;she lowered her voice, and
looked round about her impressively&mdash;"I should like
to know what you think of this business?"</p>

<p>"I've scarcely had time to think about it at all yet,"
replied Gilbert.</p>

<p>"My brother Daniel has surprised us all," said
Mrs. Stocker. "I don't like sly people; I should have
thought that he would have been only too glad to take
me into his confidence. But, no&mdash;oh dear, no! He is
glad, of course, to ignore me&mdash;and then to invite me
down here on sufferance, as it were."</p>

<p>"Can you tell me where your brother is now?"
asked Gilbert, moving towards the door.</p>

<p>"I cannot say," said Mrs. Stocker, in an affected
voice. "I believe Daniel drives out a great deal. He
might have asked me certainly to go with him; but no
one ever thinks of me."</p>

<p>Gilbert was crossing the hall, still intent upon that
search, when he was approached by the elderly manservant&mdash;staid
husband of the housekeeper&mdash;who
had been in charge of the house for years. The man
hesitated for a moment, with puzzled face, remembering
his strange instructions as to the new tenants; and
Gilbert, seeing that the man had something to say,
opened the door of a room and went in, beckoning the
man to follow. He closed the door and waited.</p>

<p>"Do you want to speak to me?" he asked.</p>

<p>"To know, sir, if everything is all right," responded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
the man in a low tone. "Also, sir, to understand
how long it's to last."</p>

<p>"Until you have orders to the contrary, or until
Mr. Meggison goes," said Gilbert, after a moment's
pause. "Why do you ask?"</p>

<p>"Only, sir, on account of the wines and such-like,"
replied the man in an aggrieved tone. "Your friends
was to have all that they required, and no questions
asked; but I didn't quite understand it was to be
champagne here, and champagne there&mdash;to say nothing
of spirits in what I may call a fashion that is
absolutely <i>had lib</i>, sir. Mr. Meggison, sir, and the
young man&mdash;beg pardon, gentleman&mdash;they do put
away a great deal."</p>

<p>"That's all right," said Gilbert easily. "You
were quite right to mention it, of course. Anything
else?"</p>

<p>"Only the manners of the two gents is a little bit
'arsh, if I may use the word, in regard to me and the
other servants; also the young gent is not particular
as to language if a little heated, sir."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry; I've no doubt his tone will improve
from this time," replied Gilbert grimly. "That will
do; and be careful to remember what I have said; I
am only a guest here for the present. You take all
your orders from Mr. Meggison."</p>

<p>The man was going slowly out of the room when he
turned back and looked again at his master. Gilbert
Byfield turned a lowering gloomy face to the man, and
asked somewhat impatiently what more he wanted.</p>

<p>"Only one thing, sir; I wouldn't have you think for
a moment that in any remarks it has been my duty to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
make concerning your friends I should be thought to
include the young lady."</p>

<p>Gilbert's face lightened a little, and he looked at
the man quickly. "Oh&mdash;so you don't complain
about the young lady?" he said.</p>

<p>"Between you and me, sir&mdash;if I may take so bold
a liberty&mdash;if it 'adn't been for the young lady I
don't think that any of us could have stood it. Oil on
the waters more than once Miss Meggison's been&mdash;and
always a smile if she wants anything&mdash;and always
sorry to give any trouble. Fairly on her knees
to her the wife is, Mr. Byfield, sir."</p>

<p>"Then that's a great compensation&mdash;isn't it?"
asked Gilbert, laughing.</p>

<p>"It's everything, sir," replied the man earnestly.
"Though, if you'll excuse the saying, it licks me how
the young lady could ever 'ave had such a father&mdash;to
say nothing of such a brother. Asking your pardon,
of course, sir."</p>

<p>Gilbert decided that he would do no good in the
matter by forcing the issue; on the other hand, he
might strengthen his position if he waited, and saw for
himself what was happening. He rightly judged that
Meggison at least would be anxious to know what
steps the outraged owner of the house at Fiddler's
Green would take, and would in all probability in very
fear be the first to approach Byfield.</p>

<p>He decided to wait at least until evening.</p>

<p>In that great game that was being played, as poor
Bessie fondly believed in reality at last, she had determined
that it should at least be played properly.
Thus dinner was a special function, and a solemn one;
and although neither Mr. Meggison nor his son had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
yet reached that sublime point insisted upon in the
pictures in the illustrated papers of "dressing" for
it, she yet had hopes even that that might some day be
accomplished. As a matter of fact, Aubrey, the better
to show his complete independence, had a fashion
of strolling in a little late, and sitting down attired in
very loud riding clothes; old Daniel Meggison sported
a frock-coat somewhat too large for him, and so was
passable. Bessie fulfilled the dream of many years,
and appeared always in white.</p>

<p>On this particular occasion the dinner gong had
gone for some minutes, and after waiting uneasily
Bessie had at last suggested that perhaps they had
better go in to dinner. Meggison had not appeared,
nor his son; the tale was complete otherwise. They
straggled awkwardly across the hall, and into the big
dining-room; and there the girl took one end of the
table, and quietly indicated where the others should
sit. The head of the table was vacant, and one other
place; and Gilbert found himself watching with
amusement to see what would presently happen.</p>

<p>Suddenly the door was flung open, and Daniel
Meggison came in quickly, smiling broadly and with
a somewhat feverish air of patronage. He did not
even look at Gilbert; but he glanced round at the
others as he took his seat, and tucked one corner of his
napkin inside his collar.</p>

<p>"You should not have waited," he said quickly.
"Unexpectedly detained; so many things to see to in
a place like this. My child"&mdash;this to Bessie down
the length of the table&mdash;"you remind me of your
poor mother. That frock suits you."</p>

<p>"Thank you, father," said the girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>Daniel Meggison began to gulp soup at a great
rate; paused to say over his spoon&mdash;"Pretty
country about here, Mr. Byfield&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"Very," replied Gilbert, looking at him steadily.
"Do you find the house convenient?"</p>

<p>"There are certain things in it that I should
change if it actually belonged to me," replied Meggison
critically&mdash;"but it'll serve&mdash;it'll serve. I could
suggest half a dozen ways in which money might be
spent to improve it."</p>

<p>"In my opinion there's a lot of ground wasted,"
said Mrs. Stocker gloomily. "What's anyone want
with more than a bit in front to keep people from
staring in at the windows, and a bit behind to put
a few seeds in? Why, you could build four houses this
size on the place, and still have a lot of land to cut to
waste. Of course, if I'm wrong I stand corrected;
but I know what house property's worth."</p>

<p>It was at this moment that Mr. Aubrey Meggison
entered the room. He came in with the inevitable
cigarette drooping from his lips, but condescended to
toss that into the fireplace; then seated himself, and
expressed the hope that there might be some hot soup
left, unless anybody had chosen to "wolf it."</p>

<p>"If you came in at a decent time you would partake
of the same dishes as other people, and at the
same moment," said Daniel Meggison crushingly.
"In future, sir, you will clearly understand that unless
you arrive at the moment&mdash;I repeat, sir, at the
moment&mdash;you won't get&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't think anybody's paying any real attention
to you, dad," said Aubrey patiently. "And perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
others may want to get a word in on their own account."</p>

<p>Daniel Meggison muttered and spluttered over his
soup; Gilbert seized the opportunity to turn to Bessie.
"And what do you do with yourself all day in the
country&mdash;you who used always to be so busy?" he
asked.</p>

<p>She turned to him with a smile. "Oh, there seems
to be such a lot to do," she replied quickly. "So many
people want me&mdash;and there are flowers to arrange&mdash;and
orders to give&mdash;and half a hundred things to do.
And then, of course, I'm obliged to go and see the
dogs&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who bark very early in the morning, and kick up
a devil of a row at night," snapped Meggison from his
end of the table.</p>

<p>"Yes, of course&mdash;the dogs," went on Gilbert, taking
no notice of the interruption. "There's Ponto&mdash;and
Billy&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;how did you know their names?" she
asked, with a puzzled look in her eyes.</p>

<p>He saw in a moment the blunder he had made.
"Why&mdash;your father&mdash;Mr. Meggison told me all
about them," he replied lamely, with a quick glance
down the table.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes&mdash;I told him&mdash;I mentioned it this afternoon,"
said Meggison hastily. "I found he was very
deeply interested in dogs."</p>

<p>Gilbert saw that it was impossible to talk to the girl
just then; he knew that Meggison at least was watching
every gesture and listening to every word. He
contented himself with looking at the girl; noting
little subtle differences in her, and seeing that the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
unnatural sharpness that had belonged to her scheming
plotting life had already worn away and left her
softened. Her hair was differently and more generously
arranged; there was a refinement and a delicacy
about her, greater even than that which had at first
singled her out in his eyes in Arcadia Street. And it
was pleasant, too, sitting there, to have her eyes
turned occasionally in his direction, and always to see
in their depths that fine smile of comradeship and
friendliness. As the meal progressed he found himself
weighing her against the others; noting their coarseness
and their awkwardness and their airs and attitudes;
and seeing her so different that she might not
have belonged to them at all. Of all that strange
assortment in the house at Fiddler's Green she was
the one who seemed properly to belong there.</p>

<p>They were getting to the end of the meal when a
servant entered and spoke a little diffidently to Bessie,
after a glance at old Meggison. "Mr. Quarle is here,
Miss."</p>

<p>Bessie sprang to her feet at once. "Oh, please
bring him in," she exclaimed; "how delightful that he
should have come to-night. You know Mr. Quarle,
Mr. Byfield?" she added.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes&mdash;I know him quite well," said Gilbert.</p>

<p>"Quarle has nothing to do with us now; he's an unpleasant
reminder of things I endeavour to forget,"
said Meggison peevishly. "Second visit, too; what's
he think he's going to get out of us? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ah!&mdash;my
dear Quarle&mdash;delighted to see you," he broke off
hurriedly as Simon came into the room, looking
sharply about him. "I was just saying to my daughter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
Bessie how very charming .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a place for Mr.
Quarle there; what the devil are you standing staring
for; don't you know your duties?"</p>

<p>Simon Quarle cocked an eyebrow comically at sight
of Byfield, and then, with a nod to the others, came
round the table, and shook hands with Bessie. "I'll
find room here, thank you," he said, as he pulled up a
chair beside the girl&mdash;"no one need disturb themselves
on my account. Well&mdash;and how's the little
girl getting on?" he asked, taking no notice of anyone
else.</p>

<p>Gilbert Byfield watched him, wondering a little what
the object of this visit might be. He noted the old
man's tenderness for the girl&mdash;the change in his
tones when he spoke to her; he saw also, or thought
he saw, a new grimness about the lines of his mouth.
He knew in his own mind that something must be settled
this night; felt certain that with this man in the
house the bubble must be pricked, and poor Bessie be
shown in a moment this new and horrible game of
make-believe in which she had really had no part.
Looking at the happy face of the girl, he seemed
more than ever to separate her from those who had
plotted, with her for a shield, and who had not hesitated
to bite the hand that fed them.</p>

<p>"You didn't let us know you were coming," hinted
Daniel Meggison.</p>

<p>"I didn't think it necessary," retorted Quarle, with
a momentary glance at him. "Now I beg that just as
soon as you have finished&mdash;all of you&mdash;you will go
away and leave me with my young hostess," he added.
"I've a great deal to say to Bessie&mdash;and I'm desperately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
hungry&mdash;and I know that I'm very late. No
ceremony, I beg."</p>

<p>"You seem quite to take possession of the house,
Mr. Quarle," said Daniel Meggison, half rising from
his chair.</p>

<p>"Exactly. Just as you have done, you know," said
Simon Quarle, with a grim nod at him. "Don't you
worry; Bessie understands."</p>

<p>It was curious to see how in that ill-assorted household
one and another of them took the hint and went
away. First Mrs. Stocker, with a toss of the head
and much rustling of skirts; followed obediently by
her husband. Then Daniel&mdash;followed at a grumbling
interval by his son. So that at the last Bessie
sat between Simon Quarle and Gilbert Byfield. And
from one to the other, before her unconscious eyes,
swept meaning glances; glances that meant appeal on
the part of Gilbert, and determination on the part of
Quarle.</p>

<p>"I'm going to talk to your father," said Gilbert at
last, rising from his place, and looking squarely at
Quarle. "We've not had a chat together yet."</p>

<p>"We'll excuse you," said Quarle gruffly. Then, as
the younger man was moving towards the door, he got
up quickly and followed him. "I wonder what they're
doing about my bag," he began; and then, as he
thrust Gilbert into the hall in front of him&mdash;and
closed the door&mdash;"Well&mdash;so you've made up your
mind that something must be done&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;something must be done&mdash;and to-night,"
whispered Gilbert quickly. "I can promise you that
at least."</p>

<p>"Good." Quarle nodded, and turned to go back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
into the room. "I'm glad you see the necessity for
that. Don't spare them."</p>

<p>"I want only to spare <i>her</i>," said Gilbert.</p>

<p>Mr. Daniel Meggison proved to be as difficult of
capture as before. In the drawing-room he was talking
of the value and the security of having a stake
in the country to his sister and brother-in-law; on the
appearance of Gilbert he button-holed Mr. Stocker,
and began rapidly to ask his candid opinion concerning
the work of our parish councils, and whether he
did not think they required new blood&mdash;as, for
instance, new blood from London, in the shape of a
man who had had experience of the vicissitudes of life,
and who knew what real government meant? Gilbert
remaining, and looking at him steadily, he began to
see that the matter had to be brought to a crisis, and
could not much longer be delayed. Therefore he
turned with an air of forced geniality to Byfield, and
actually took him by the arm.</p>

<p>"You have something to talk to me about, Mr.
Byfield?" he demanded with sublime assurance "As
a matter of fact, too, I should like your advice on a
little question of investments; I am a child in these
matters&mdash;save accidentally. Suppose we have a bit of
a talk&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"Nothing would please me better," Gilbert answered.</p>

<p>"Then, if my dear sister will excuse us&mdash;we will
go and smoke a friendly cigar, and have a dry business
chat," said Meggison, drawing Gilbert towards
the door. "I want some sound advice."</p>

<p>They went towards a small room which had been
used by Gilbert as a smoking-room; it was empty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
although a lamp burned on a small table at one end.
Meggison closed the door, and went into the room;
threw himself on to a couch, and looked up smilingly
at the other man. His face was rather white, and he
had something of the air of a schoolboy about to
receive punishment that he knew he had deserved;
but his manner was as jaunty as ever.</p>

<p>"Now, sir&mdash;what do you want with me?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Bluntly&mdash;an account of your stewardship,
Meggison," said Gilbert. "I need hardly remind
you of the facts; you were to come down here with
your daughter; you were to give her that rest and
that holiday she so sorely needed."</p>

<p>"Will you deny that she is having that rest and
that holiday?" asked Meggison, with a grin. "Isn't
there a wonderful change in her?"</p>

<p>"I thank God&mdash;yes," said Gilbert Byfield steadily.
"But it is not of that I am speaking; I am
referring to the fashion in which you are flinging
money broadcast&mdash;you and your dissolute son; I
refer to this persistent fairy-tale that you have a
great fortune, and that you are here for the remainder
of your life. You have sold up the house in
Arcadia Street; you are living on my charity."</p>

<p>"My good man," retorted Meggison, with a new
insolence in his voice&mdash;"you appear to forget all
the circumstances; more than that, you appear to
forget what manner of man you are dealing with;
you lose sight of the fact that you are dealing with
<i>me</i>. If you wanted your absurd scheme carried out
in any halting cheeseparing fashion, you should have
gone to a meaner man; you should not have come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
to Daniel Meggison. I am a creature of imagination;
I soar, sir; I refuse to be confined or held
back. I think only of my daughter, who in your
own words was to have a much-needed rest and holiday;
I have given her both. I let facts and results
speak for themselves."</p>

<p>"I see it is quite useless to argue the matter with
you," said Gilbert. "I intend to take the matter
into my own hands; I intend to let Bessie understand
the true facts of the case, so that she may know
exactly where she stands. And I intend to do that
to-night."</p>

<p>Mr. Daniel Meggison rose to his feet, and thrust
his hands in his pockets, and nodded brightly.
"Splendid notion! I applaud it. Do it by all
means; don't think of me in the least. Go to my
daughter, and say to her&mdash;'I have to tell you that
your father, for your dear sake, has lied to you, and
cheated you, and made a fool of you. Egged on by
a man with whom, under ordinary circumstances, he
would have had nothing to do, your poor old father
has tried to do something for you at last&mdash;to make
your life easier.' Go to Bessie, and tell her that&mdash;make
her understand that all her house of cards must
topple down, and that she must for the future loathe
the man she now believes in and loves. The way is
easy; it only requires a very few words."</p>

<p>"You know I can't do that; you know you've
got me hard and fast, because in front of you and
all your scheming stands the girl who does not deserve
to suffer. I must bring myself down, I suppose,
to appeal to you," said Gilbert. "I want you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
to release me; I want you to find a way out of the
tangle you have created for us all."</p>

<p>"And I say that I decline to do anything of the
kind," said Daniel Meggison. "I take my stand
upon the happiness of my child; I raise my banner
for her sake, and I fight to my last breath!"</p>

<p>"And very nobly said, too!" A voice came from
the further end of the room, and there rose from
the depths of an easy chair there, the back of which
had been towards them, the long form of Aubrey
Meggison. He held a sporting paper in his hands,
and he now lounged forward, so as to put himself in
a measure between the two men. "I don't always
say that I uphold the old man, mind you," he added&mdash;"but
on this occasion I think he has spoken as only
a father and a man could speak. I suppose, Mr.
Byfield," went on the youth aggressively, as he
tossed the paper into the chair he had left&mdash;"I
suppose it didn't occur to you that there might be
such a thing&mdash;or such a being&mdash;as a man of the
world to deal with&mdash;not an old man you could bully&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon; in a sense I had forgotten
you," said Gilbert, a little helplessly. "I quite
understand that if only from motives of policy alone
you would take the side of your father. I've nothing
further to say to either of you."</p>

<p>They were glancing triumphantly at each other&mdash;the
father with a new friendliness for the son&mdash;as
Gilbert went out of the room. In the hall he stumbled
upon Simon Quarle; was seized upon by that
gentleman with the one inevitable question.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm going to settle the matter&mdash;once and for
all&mdash;with the girl," said Gilbert; and with a new
feeling that he was being goaded into this thing
went on to find her.</p>

<p>He found her, after some inquiries, just where he
had expected her to be; she was wandering alone in
the warm summer evening in that newer garden that
had so eclipsed the old one. For a little time they
walked side by side there; there seemed to be no
actual need for words. He had told himself, as he
came out of the house, that he would have done this
night with the mad business; he told himself now,
as he saw her face in the light of the stars, that it
must go on. And even while he said that the natural
man sprang up in him&mdash;the man who would not
easily or lightly give way, and would no longer be
robbed with impunity. Not in any spirit of meanness,
but because of the dastardly fashion in which
these people held out this innocent girl as their bait
and their bribe.</p>

<p>Almost it seemed, in that quiet garden under the
stars, that the two were alone. So that presently
they stopped, with hand strangely holding hand;
and it seemed almost that this new Bessie of the
bright eyes was a woman. Her dreams had come
true; the friend who had told her that they might
some day come true was here with her, alone under
the shining heavens. It was a matter of whispers&mdash;just
the simple matter that it always must be in
such an hour.</p>

<p>"Little friend&mdash;are you very happy?" he whispered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>"Happier than I have ever been in all my life,"
she replied.</p>

<p>"Long ago, Bessie (or it seems long ago), in
Arcadia Street we were friends&mdash;in that poor old
garden that was never a garden at all. I'm a very
lonely man, Bessie, and it seems to me to-night that
I want my friend."</p>

<p>"Yes?" She looked up into his eyes; and seemed
insensibly, in the dusk of the garden, to creep nearer
to him.</p>

<p>"I want you, Bessie; there was never a woman in
this world that was like you; you've stolen your way
into my heart somehow. Bessie&mdash;if to-night I
asked you to leave all this, and for love's sake to come
away with me&mdash;out into the big world&mdash;what
would you say?"</p>

<p>"I could only say what my heart is saying now,"
she whispered. "I should say&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>"Would you? Are you sure?" She was warm
and tender and fluttering in his arms. "Are you
sure?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;because I love you," she breathed.</p>

<p>And so she tied again that strange tangled knot
he had tried so hard to cut.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />

<small>A DESPERATE REMEDY</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>WHATEVER judgment may be passed upon
Byfield's methods at that time, it has to be
remembered that up to that moment&mdash;and indeed
long afterwards, in a lesser degree&mdash;he had regarded
Bessie Meggison as a child. She was in his
eyes a mere waif out of that London of which he
knew but little; a mere pretty bit of flotsam flung
at his feet in the stress and storm of the world, to
be cherished by him very tenderly. That other people,
with schemes and designs of their own, clung
to her and therefore to him, was but an accidental
circumstance that did not really affect her. He had
to remember the conventionalities of the world&mdash;had
to remember, for instance, that she was in reality
poor and friendless and of no account, and that he
had, on a mere foolish impulse, placed her suddenly
in an impossible position. That which had seemed
so simple at first was simple no longer.</p>

<p>And now, with that sudden declaration of her love
for him, she had bound him to her with a tie more
difficult to be broken than any with which he had been
bound yet. His generosity was stirred&mdash;the natural
chivalry of the man, that had only before been
stirred to a sort of whimsical tenderness, woke to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
full life. More than ever was it necessary that that
strange fiction should be kept up; because now, if
she learned the truth, he knew that she must be
doubly shamed: first because of the trick he had
played upon her, and next because he had surprised
from her that confession of love which she would
never have spoken had she not believed that their
worldly positions were pretty much the same.</p>

<p>And he had asked her to go out into the world
with him&mdash;still under that false impression&mdash;and
she had leapt to the one conclusion, and the one only.
His had been a matter of tenderness for the child
for whom he was sorry; hers the love of a woman
for a man who was the first and the greatest man in
her life, because he had seemed to understand her.
There was no going back now; they must tread the
road on which he had been leading her until some
end came that he could not yet foresee.</p>

<p>The one vague thought in his mind had been
to lift her clean out of that tangle in which they
were both involved, and to leave Daniel Meggison
and his son to struggle out of it for themselves. He
told himself fiercely, again and again, that he had
nothing to do with Daniel Meggison, save as an
instrument for the furthering of that innocent plan
to help Bessie. The father was unworthy of the
child; he had lived upon her hard work for years,
and was ready to turn her to account in any way
at any moment; clearly he was not to be reckoned
with. Gilbert held before him always the remembrance
of the girl, and the girl only; argued that
she would be better off with himself than with anyone
else. All the old platitudes were called into play;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
she had but one life, and of that the best must be
made&mdash;and love was superior to everything else&mdash;and
love was the one thing worth living for and
striving for. Of any Bessie grown older and wiser&mdash;of
any Bessie grown ashamed, when she came to
understand what the world was, he never thought
at all. She stretched out to him now the trembling
eager hands of a child, and pleaded for love and
beauty and happiness; he would give her all three.</p>

<p>He was in a difficult position. He knew that a
breath&mdash;a look&mdash;a whisper might in a moment
teach her the truth; he knew that Simon Quarle was
waiting in the house, dogged and persistent, and determined
that the truth should be told; he knew also
that Daniel Meggison, if he once understood that the
game was up, would not hesitate to blurt out unpleasant
facts in mere viciousness. Whatever was
to be done must be done quickly.</p>

<p>Impulsive always, Gilbert did not stop to reason
now, any more than he had ever done. Wealth had
been his always, and the impulse of the moment could
always be gratified; the one impulse now was to get
the girl away from Fiddler's Green, and so turn the
tables, first on the father and son, and afterwards
on that arch meddler, Simon Quarle. He broached
the matter that very night, within a few moments of
the time when her innocent declaration had been
made.</p>

<p>"I wonder if you understand what I mean, little
Bessie?" he whispered. "Love means a giving-up&mdash;a
sacrifice; with a woman it should mean that she
has no will of her own, but does blindly for love's
sake everything that her lover demands."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I understand that," she replied, looking
at him wonderingly.</p>

<p>"When I said just now that I wanted to ask you
to come away with me&mdash;out into the big world that
you have never seen yet&mdash;I meant it. There are
great places across the sea&mdash;wide lands that are
wonderful, cities where the sun always shines. If
I asked you to come away with me, and leave all
this behind&mdash;would you do that?"</p>

<p>"Of course," she replied, still with her eyes fixed
upon his. "You would have the right&mdash;wouldn't
you?"</p>

<p>Her simplicity unnerved him; her innocence was
something that seemed to stand between him and her
understanding of him. "My dear, you make me
almost afraid of you," he said. "Do you trust me
so completely?"</p>

<p>She nodded, and laughed confidently. "I can't
tell you how much," she said shyly. "Only, ever so
long ago, as it seems, when you looked over the wall
into my poor garden in Arcadia Street, you made
everything so different. I was only tired and lonely
and sad after that when you went away. Don't go
away from me again, because I could not bear it. I
was afraid before that the happiness that father's
fortune brought was too great to last; and now
this that is greater has been added to it. If you are
ever to take that away from me, I would be more
glad that you should kill me to-night, so that I might
not ever know."</p>

<p>"In this world of surprises, Bessie," he said,
"there is yet another surprise for you. I'm not
so poor as you thought I was. I only let you believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
that I was poor, because it would have seemed
a mean thing for me to appear rich when you had
nothing&mdash;wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>"And are you as rich as father is?"</p>

<p>"There's no actual comparison," he assured her.
"But if I'm not very rich myself, at least I have
rich friends&mdash;people who like me, and know me,
and with whom I travel about the world sometimes.
Now one of those rich friends of mine has a yacht."</p>

<p>It was still necessary that he should lie to her, in
his dread lest she might suspect the real truth; and
so this additional lie was added to the heap. Even
then she suspected nothing; even then it never occurred
to her to link the fact of this man's unsuspected
wealth with that other fact of the unexpected
wealth of Daniel Meggison.</p>

<p>"Now, they call that yacht <i>Blue Bird</i>, and she
lies ready to take us away over the seas, miles and
miles away, so that we may discover all those wonderful
places that I've tried to tell you about. She's
a big yacht, and she's very comfortable; and she's
just waiting until Bessie Meggison puts her small
feet on her white deck, and then she's off!"</p>

<p>She was silent for a moment or two; the man wondered
of what she was thinking. He put a hand
under her chin and raised her face; she was looking
at him solemnly.</p>

<p>"And you want me to leave this place&mdash;and to
go right away&mdash;with you?" she asked. "For how
long?"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't exactly know how long, dear&mdash;perhaps
just as long as you like to cruise about,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
he replied, a little uneasily. "Don't forget, Bessie,
that you promised."</p>

<p>"I know&mdash;because you were lonely, and because
you wanted me," she said simply. "That's where
you have the right&mdash;because we love each other.
I was only thinking&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her voice trailed off, and she stood very still; and
once again the man wondered of what she was thinking,
and yet did not question her. Knowing in an
uncomfortable way that she would do what he asked,
he thought it wisest not to put the matter more
clearly before her, and not to enter into any further
explanation. Instead, he began to tell her what
she must do.</p>

<p>"I shall start off early to-morrow to see that the
yacht is all right," he said. "Then you will slip
away, and you will follow me to Newhaven. When
you get to Newhaven, you will ask for the steam
yacht <i>Blue Bird</i>, and you will come straight on
board. Now, do you understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I understand perfectly," she replied.
"And I am to leave Fiddler's Green&mdash;leave everybody?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;leave them all behind. Aunts and uncles,
and Simon Quarles and everything; we don't want
them. I shall wait at Newhaven until you come."</p>

<p>She made no direct reply, but he seemed to understand
that she had made up her mind, and that she
would come. When presently they went back to the
house, she slipped away, saying that she wanted to
find her father; Gilbert set about what he had to do
with a curious feeling of elation, and yet with a still
more curious feeling of remorse and bitterness. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
told himself savagely that he had not done this thing;
that his impulses had been generous ones that had
been taken advantage of by Daniel Meggison and
by his son; that therefore they were directly responsible.
He meant to be very good to her; she
should have a better time than she had ever had yet.</p>

<p>Simon Quarle&mdash;restless and watchful like himself&mdash;met
him presently wandering about the
house; and once more faced him squarely, with a
demand as to what he was going to do. "The girl's
got to be lifted out of this slough of deceit and lies
and humbug; she's too honest to live in it," said the
old man. "Try gentle means, if you can&mdash;if you
don't, I must try rougher ones."</p>

<p>"I've fully made up my mind what to do," said
Gilbert in reply. "To-morrow our game of make-believe
will end; Mr. Daniel Meggison has come
to the end of his tether."</p>

<p>"I'm glad of it," said Quarle.</p>

<p>Finally, Gilbert sought again that servant who was
responsible for the house, and gave him certain instructions.
"I'm going away to-morrow," he said&mdash;"and
from that time my friend Mr. Meggison's
connection with the house ceases. You will say nothing
about it, of course; you will simply give him
to understand that you've got my instructions to
close the place, and that he cannot remain here any
longer. Do you understand? From to-morrow night
they all go&mdash;every one of 'em."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir," replied the man, looking at him
a little curiously.</p>

<p>Still telling himself that what he was doing was
right, and that no other course lay open to him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
Gilbert Byfield went unhappily out of the house, and
wandered about in the grounds. "I'm a mean
brute," he muttered to himself&mdash;"and I'm sneaking
out of a business that I'm afraid to face openly.
But it's no good: I can't look into her eyes and tell
her the truth; I can't drive her back penniless and
friendless into Arcadia Street. The child loves me;
in a sense we are both waifs of fortune&mdash;and in that
sense we'll face life together. The whole circumstances
are so mad and strange that they must be
faced in a mad and strange manner. And oh!&mdash;I
mean to be good to her!"</p>

<p>While he stood there he saw before him, coming
dancingly towards him through the trees, a little
point of light; and knew it, after a moment or two,
for the smouldering end of a cigarette. Wondering
a little who this was at such an hour, he waited until
the figure of a man followed the dancing point of
light, and revealed itself as Mr. Jordan Tant. Mr.
Tant, in evening dress, and looking even more immaculate
than usual, expressed no surprise at seeing
his friend, although in a curious way he seemed a
little afraid of the big man facing him.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Byfield," said Mr. Tant precisely.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;have you come to spy out the land,
friend Tant?" demanded Gilbert, with a rough
laugh.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;and no," said Mr. Tant, flicking the
ash from his cigarette, and looking at it with his head
on one side. "As you are aware, I am always doing
something for others&mdash;or perhaps I should say
for <i>one</i> other. Enid and her mother are naturally
anxious to know what is happening to you; also they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
are curious concerning the people who have taken
your cottage. You may not know that they are
down here?"</p>

<p>"I did not know&mdash;but I am not surprised," replied
Gilbert. "Where are they staying?"</p>

<p>"They have taken rooms&mdash;extremely uncomfortable
rooms, and very high-priced&mdash;at a house in
the village," said Mr. Tant. "Enid complains&mdash;chiefly
to me; therefore you may guess that I am
remarkably unhappy, and that indirectly I blame
you for my unhappiness. I strolled over to-night
to see you; they will naturally demand to know
what <i>I</i> know about you."</p>

<p>"Then you can give them my message," said Gilbert,
a little contemptuously. "You can tell them
that I decline to have my actions criticized by any
one; you can let them understand that I know that
they had no real reason for coming to Fiddler's
Green, and taking uncomfortable lodgings, except in
order to find out what I was doing. You can tell
them&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Byfield&mdash;but I can't tell
them anything of the kind," said Mr. Tant. "You
can't send messages of that description&mdash;and I can't
take them."</p>

<p>"You're quite right, my Tant; of course you
can't," replied Gilbert. "I'm obliged to you for reminding
me. Forgive me; I'm a little worried and
troubled, and I seem to think that everyone about me
is plotting against me, and scheming against me."</p>

<p>"My dear Byfield&mdash;why don't you shake these
people off?" asked Tant, lowering his voice. "Common
charity is one thing; but these people will stick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
to you like leeches till they've sucked your very blood.
After all, as I have said so often, one must draw the
line somewhere, you know."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I know; and I'm going to draw the line to-morrow,"
said Gilbert, half to himself. "However,
if the ladies have not retired, I'll stroll down with you
and see them. Come along!"</p>

<p>"They'll be delighted, I'm sure," said Tant, without
the least cordiality.</p>

<p>They found Mrs. Ewart-Crane and her daughter
astonishing so much of the village as remained awake
by sitting in an extremely small garden in front of an
unpretentious cottage stiffly on chairs in evening
dress; behind them was the lighted room in which they
had just been dining. Mrs. Ewart-Crane greeted
Gilbert grimly, and hoped he was well; Enid nodded,
and said casually&mdash;"Ah, Gilbert"&mdash;and turned
her attention to Jordan Tant.</p>

<p>"Sorry I couldn't let you have my house," said
Gilbert&mdash;"but you see I had already let it to other
people. A little later on, perhaps&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My dear Gilbert&mdash;what is really happening?"
asked Mrs. Ewart-Crane, lowering her voice, and
turning away from the others. "Of course we all
know that there's a girl&mdash;and that she came out of
some quite impossible slum in which you chose to live.
I'm not saying that she's not perfectly nice and
good, and all that sort of thing; but you have to think
of yourself, and of the future. And I suppose that
she's got all her horrid people with her?"</p>

<p>"Some friends of mine are certainly staying at my
house down here at present," said Gilbert&mdash;"and I
originally met them in Arcadia Street, when I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
living there. It has merely been a visit&mdash;and that
visit ends almost immediately. As a matter of fact,
I'm going away to-morrow on a yachting cruise."</p>

<p>"I am relieved to hear it," said the lady, with a
sigh. "I have been perfectly miserable over the whole
business; I have not known how to sleep. I came
down here, and took these rooms to-day, on the assurance
of Jordan that they were the only ones to be had
in the place; I wanted to keep an eye on you."</p>

<p>"Extremely kind of you," he said. "Only you
see I rather object to anyone keeping an eye upon
me."</p>

<p>"Now, however, that the horrid people are going,
and that you have made up your mind in a sense to
run away also, there is no further necessity for my
remaining here," went on Mrs. Ewart-Crane. "But
tell me; do you go on this yachting cruise alone?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I've scarcely made up my mind yet," he
returned evasively; and the lady looked at him, and
silently drew in her breath and pursed her lips. "My
plans have been made rather hurriedly."</p>

<p>"Exactly," she said. "Now, my dear Gilbert&mdash;would
it not be a kindly thing to take Enid and myself
with you? I know the yacht, and I know how
very comfortable you can make your guests. And
believe me, we should be more than grateful."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I'm not able to do that just at
present," he replied. "Mine is, in a sense, a sudden
trip, and I have no real preparations made for the
reception of passengers on the yacht. I'm sorry,
but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, it doesn't matter," she said, with a smile. "It
was only a sudden thought on my part."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>Feeling annoyed and ashamed and resentful at this
cross-questioning, Gilbert presently bade them good
night curtly enough, and strolled off into the darkness
towards his own house. As he disappeared, Mrs.
Ewart-Crane turned to Jordan Tant and the girl.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;one thing I have discovered, at least," she
said viciously. "Gilbert takes the girl with him to-morrow
on this extraordinary voyage."</p>

<p>"My dear mother!" Enid rose with an appearance
of indignation. "He wouldn't do such a thing."</p>

<p>"I don't know what to make of the fellow myself,"
said Jordan Tant, with a shake of the head. "I
don't think he means any harm; I simply think he's
got himself into a deuce of a hole, and doesn't quite
know how to get out of it. That's my opinion. As
for the girl&mdash;well, of course she's decidedly pretty&mdash;and
nice-mannered&mdash;and all that kind of thing;
and so I suppose&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I think we will wish you good night, Jordan,"
said Mrs. Ewart-Crane, rising. And Jordan Tant
took the hint, and went off to his room at the village
inn.</p>

<p>Gilbert Byfield walked far that night under the
stars, and smoked many pipes. Now he was right, and
now he was wrong; now he knew that this thing was
good in the sight of that wholly impossible heaven
that smiles upon unconventional things when they are
done for a good and proper purpose. Now there was
no other way&mdash;and now there was a better way, by
which he might speak the truth, and send her back
to some Arcadia Street where she could struggle on,
and yet live the old clean fine life. Now he hated himself
for what he had settled to do; now he urged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
against a pricking conscience that Bessie loved him,
and that nothing else mattered. Still, with those
warring thoughts he got back in the small hours, and
let himself in, and went to bed.</p>

<p>There was much to be done on the following day,
and he determined to start early. He made all
necessary arrangements with the man in charge of the
house; left a brief note for Bessie, to be given into
her hands alone, in which he explained carefully what
she was to do. Then, avoiding his strange guests, who
fortunately for him were in the habit of rising late,
he found his way to the little station, and left
Fiddler's Green behind him.</p>

<p>There followed a hurried rush through London, and
the settling of various affairs there, and the dispatch
of telegrams. Late in the afternoon he found himself
at Newhaven, with a small hillock of luggage, and
facing a man who had the appearance of being half
landsman and half seaman, and who was respectfully
touching his cap to him.</p>

<p>"Ah, Pringle&mdash;so you had my wire," he said
cheerfully.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. And everything's
ready, sir," said Pringle.</p>

<p>Pringle was a long, thin, cleanly shaven man, with
a countenance absolutely without expression, save for
a pair of eyes that twinkled on occasion with a touch
of humour very unbefitting a servant. He was neatly
dressed in a blue suit, and was in fact a species of half
steward, half man-servant, who had been with his
master in various parts of the world on various occasions.
He was that sort of man who, had he received
a telegram to say that a young and lively tiger was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
being consigned to his care, would in all probability
have bought the largest and strongest dog collar and
chain obtainable, as a matter of precaution, and have
gone to meet his charge with perfect equanimity. He
had the luggage gathered together now, and in an incredibly
short space of time had deposited that and
his master on board the yacht <i>Blue Bird</i>.</p>

<p>"Quite nice to be here again, Pringle," said
Gilbert. "As you may have gathered from my wire,
there is someone else coming; make the necessary arrangements.
Also meet the trains this afternoon
coming from London; a young lady will inquire for
the yacht, and you can bring her down."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir," said Pringle; and vanished.</p>

<p>It was late in the evening when Pringle appeared
again, standing solemnly just within the cabin door.
His face was inscrutable to an ordinary observer&mdash;and
yet one might have thought that there was in his
eyes a lurking gleam of that humour that was so very
much out of place.</p>

<p>"Young lady's come aboard, sir," said Pringle.</p>

<p>Gilbert sprang up, and pushed the man aside, and
went out and mounted the companion. There was
Bessie&mdash;smiling and bright-eyed, and obviously very
excited; as he took her hands, and looked at her
delightedly, she broke out into a flood of speech.</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear&mdash;such a journey&mdash;and yet I'm
so glad to be here. I don't know how I should have
managed it&mdash;all alone and not knowing anything
much about travelling&mdash;if it hadn't have been for
dear father."</p>

<p>"Dear father?" he repeated, with a curious chill
creeping into his heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, of course," she replied. "You see, I
couldn't come without father&mdash;and besides, he would
have broken his heart if I had gone away without him.
So I told him all you said, and all that you were going
to do; and he worked hard to get things packed, and
to get us off. See&mdash;there he is!"</p>

<p>Gilbert dropped her hands, and walked a pace or
two along the deck to where a man was standing looking
over the side. The man turned, and revealed the
smiling features of Daniel Meggison; Daniel in the
frock-coat much too large for him&mdash;a silk hat
perched upon one side of his head&mdash;and with an
umbrella half unfurled grasped tightly by the middle
in one hand. Daniel waved the umbrella cheerfully
as he advanced to meet Byfield.</p>

<p>"Ha!&mdash;so here we are!" he exclaimed, with much
heartiness. "Beautiful vessel&mdash;very trim and ship-shape.
Splendid notion!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />

<small>PURSUIT</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>THE explanation of that coming of Daniel
Meggison to the yacht is a very simple one.
He had seen for himself that the game could not last
very much longer; he knew that in all probability
Byfield would fling caution to the winds, and expose
the trick that Meggison and his son were playing.
Therefore he watched that young man with more
anxiety than he really showed; despite the bravado
he displayed, Meggison was really in deadly fear of
what was to happen.</p>

<p>The sudden going of Gilbert from the house, while
it might have allayed the suspicions of a less cunning
man than Meggison, only served to increase them in
his case. He felt that in all probability Byfield had
but gone away to seek advice or assistance; Meggison
began to think that after all the game had been played
a little too boldly, and a little too extravagantly. He
blamed himself that he had not been more cautious;
they might then have hung on for quite a long time.</p>

<p>Prying about the house, in the hope to discover
something, Daniel Meggison became aware of the fact
that no one seemed in the least surprised at Byfield's
departure. True, a question was asked by Simon
Quarle, but no definite answer given; Mr. and Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
Stocker paid no attention to chance visitors. The
astounding thing to Daniel Meggison was that Bessie
took no notice of Gilbert's departure, but went about
the house singing gaily, and evidently very busy over
something in her room. She flitted backwards and
forwards to that room with an air of great mystery.</p>

<p>Meggison summoned courage at last to mount the
stairs, and to set off in search of her. At the very
door of the room, as he knocked, he was confronted by
Bessie, who had opened it at that very moment; she
smiled at him, and beckoned him in, and closed the
door again.</p>

<p>"My child," he whispered with deep anxiety&mdash;"what
is happening?"</p>

<p>"Father dear, I'm running away," she said, with
eyes dancing like those of a child. "And you are going
to run away with me."</p>

<p>"But why, my dear? Why leave the beauties of
the country?&mdash;why run away at all? Please explain,"
he pleaded.</p>

<p>"Sit down here, father, while I go on with my
packing," she commanded&mdash;"and I'll tell you all
about it. It's so wonderful that you'll scarcely believe
it at first; so strange that it would be hard for
anyone to believe it. Please don't interrupt me&mdash;because
I shall have things to pack for you presently,
before we run away together."</p>

<p>"I am of a singularly patient nature," said Daniel
Meggison, seating himself and folding his hands.
"Pray proceed, Bessie."</p>

<p>She proceeded then glibly enough to tell him of all
that had happened; of how the Prince of that fairy
tale that had come true so strangely had come down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
there, and had told her that he loved her. There was
much that she could not tell her father, beyond the
bald fact; but he would understand, and he would
know that when the Prince commanded, his willing
slave must follow.</p>

<p>"He wanted me to run away with him out into the
world&mdash;to sail far over the sea with him in this yacht
that has been lent to him by a friend," said Bessie,
on her knees beside one of the new trunks, busily folding
garments. "But of course that wouldn't do at
all&mdash;because, although I know Gilbert perfectly, and
know how good he is, ladies mustn't travel about with
gentlemen in that promiscuous way. More than all,
it is necessary of course that a certain poor old
father, quite incapable of looking after himself,
should not be left behind; therefore that father comes
in, as usual, very happily." She jumped up at that
point, specially to kiss the old reprobate, who was
thinking long thoughts.</p>

<p>"Wise little Bessie!" he said, patting her head.
"I might have known that you would make no mistake
over a matter of that kind. And so friend Byfield
wants to take away his bride that is to be, and give
her a little holiday on the sea&mdash;eh? Well&mdash;that
seems a very excellent idea, and I promise you that
you shall not find your poor old father in the way.
But a word of warning, my Bessie!" He turned
in his chair, and faced his daughter solemnly.</p>

<p>"Yes, father dear?"</p>

<p>"Not a word to anyone else&mdash;not a syllable!" he
whispered. "Let us slip away together, leaving the
other people in comfort here; we can write to them
from some foreign port. Because, you see, we don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
want to annoy our friend Byfield; and he might not
have accommodation for everybody on this wonderful
yacht. Your brother and the others will be very comfortable
here; but as we do not wish to make them
envious, we will say nothing about our new plans."</p>

<p>"But when they find we're gone, they'll naturally
be worried to know what has become of us," urged
Bessie.</p>

<p>"True, my child, most true," he responded. "On
second thoughts, it would perhaps be better to leave
a note for them&mdash;a carefully worded diplomatic note&mdash;not
giving too much information, but just enough.
Leave that to me. I'll go and get the few things
together that I shall need, and you can come and
help me presently. Newhaven, did you say? I'm all
excitement. It's a splendid notion!"</p>

<p>The matter of getting from the house was not after
all so great a difficulty as may be imagined, for the
simple reason that that astute servant in charge of
the place saw in this packing up merely the exodus of
extraordinary tenants, one of whom at least had been
most undesirable. That they should demand that the
thing be done secretly seemed under the circumstances
reasonable enough; so that the luggage was actually
smuggled out of the house, and taken out to a back
gate, where a hired carriage was waiting.</p>

<p>"I've left the note in a prominent position, explaining
enough to set their minds at rest," said
Daniel Meggison, chuckling to himself as he got into
the carriage with the girl.</p>

<p>Mr. Daniel Meggison understood, of course,
exactly what had happened; saw, or thought he saw,
that Gilbert had cunningly determined to lift Bessie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
neatly out of all the business, and leave the others to
face the music as best they might. Daniel felt certain
that secret instructions had been given to the servants
at the house&mdash;instructions which were not to include
Bessie; and that Gilbert Byfield had made up his
mind to play a new game for himself alone. It is
probable that on the score of morality alone Daniel
Meggison did not regard the matter seriously; but
this proposed desertion of himself was little short of
a crime.</p>

<p>"After this," he though to himself, "I'll put the
screw on a bit. He thinks he'll play fast and loose
with me; he thinks he'll leave me in the lurch&mdash;does
he? He doesn't know poor old Daniel! Bessie's the
ticket&mdash;and I'll stick to her through thick and thin&mdash;poor
child! After all, it's rather lucky that she
loves her father so fondly!"</p>

<p>As we already know they arrived on board the yacht
<i>Blue Bird</i> in due course, something to the astonishment
of Gilbert Byfield, and giving him a new problem
to be faced. So far as the note that had been written
by Daniel Meggison was concerned&mdash;a mere shadowy
trail, indicating vaguely the way they had taken&mdash;that
was to be found some hours later by Mr. Aubrey
Meggison.</p>

<p>Now, Aubrey had discovered for the first time on
the previous day the real secret of that mysterious
fortune the origin of which had more than puzzled
him from the first. He was not a brilliant youth, but
he knew enough to understand that his father was
probably the last man in the world ever to have money
to speculate with, or ever to be lucky in any impossible
speculation in which he might indulge. Aubrey had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
been willing enough to accept his share of that impossible
fortune, and to shut his eyes resolutely to
everything outside the actual good realities that came
to him; but he had a feeling that in some fashion a
crash would come, involving him with the rest, in the
near future. The conversation he had overheard between
Daniel and Gilbert Byfield had given him the
clue; and he had sprung to his father's rescue with
the instinct of one who desires to save himself first of
all. But from that moment it became necessary that he
should watch the source of the unexpected wealth, the
better to be sure that that source did not run dry.</p>

<p>He knew that Gilbert was in a mood to kick over
the traces; he was not surprised to find that the master
of the house at Fiddler's Green had suddenly gone.
But when he discovered that Daniel Meggison and
Bessie were also missing, he began to be possessed by
a great fear; and when a little later he discovered the
note that had been left by his father, that fear was
changed at once into a certainty of disaster.</p>

<p>The note had been left to him, as the eldest son, as
a species of baneful legacy; it lay upon his dressing-table.</p>

<div class='blockquot'>

"<span class="smcap">My dear Aubrey</span>,

<p>"You will have gathered, from the conversation
you accidentally overheard yesterday, that our
good friend Mr. Byfield is naturally restive at the
prospect of providing for the wants not of one person
alone, but of a family. In that restiveness I cordially
agree with him; I feel that it is time a growing lad&mdash;or
youth&mdash;or young man&mdash;whichever you prefer&mdash;should
be doing something to provide for his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
wants. Mr. Byfield is interested in the welfare of
your sister, and I foresee for her an alliance in the
future which will lift her into that sphere to which
I have always felt the family should properly belong.</p>

<p>"Mr. Byfield understands that father and child
must not be separated; therefore I accompany Bessie.
We are about to start on a voyage, but our ultimate
destination is unknown; it will, however, probably be
some foreign port. Let me advise you, my son, to
keep a stout heart, and to wrest from the world
that portion which belongs equally to every one of
her sons. I shall expect to hear that you are doing
well, and are a credit to the family whose name you
bear."</p>

<p class='sig'>
<span style="margin-right: 3em;">Your father,</span><br />
"<span class="smcap">Daniel Meggison</span>."<br />
</p></div>

<p>Aubrey Meggison remained for some minutes
plunged in gloom after reading the letter; then he
said some uncomplimentary things concerning that
father who had been so willing to desert him. Child of
that father, however, he came quickly to the conclusion
that something must be done. He shivered at the
thought of being left alone in the world&mdash;even such
a world as that of Arcadia Street&mdash;with no one to
feed him, and with no convenient Bessie from whom to
borrow half-crowns and shillings.</p>

<p>"Only thing to be done, as far as I can see, is to
stick to the guv'nor," he murmured disconsolately.
"The guv'nor'll stick to Bessie, and I suppose Bessie'll
stick to that bounder Byfield. Well, there'll be a nice
string of us; and even if I am at the tail-end of it, I
don't mean to be dropped. Only thing is&mdash;where
have they gone to?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>He knew that it was quite useless to raise a hue and
cry, because that would have set others on the track,
and so have spoilt his own game. He determined to
make cautious inquiries, and in the meantime to appear
quite unsuspicious. And it happened that he
received assistance from an unexpected quarter.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ewart-Crane had had a sleepless night. She
saw herself flouted and laughed at by this slip of a
girl who had been picked out of a certain slum called
Arcadia Street&mdash;saw in imagination that imp of
common wickedness known as Bessie Meggison setting
her at naught, and leading Gilbert Byfield where she
would. Mrs. Ewart-Crane thought of her daughter,
and of that daughter's future&mdash;felt that this boy-and-girl
courtship of years before should be made a
binding thing once for all. If Mr. Gilbert Byfield did
not know what was due to himself and his friends, he
must be taught; and Mrs. Ewart-Crane, as a lady and
a mother (for so she reckoned herself, in that order
and in those actual words) was the one to teach
him.</p>

<p>Rising after that troubled night, she determined to
wait until the unlucky Jordan Tant should put in an
appearance; she meant to seize upon him as a convenient
messenger. It happened, however, that Mr.
Jordan Tant was quite content to let well alone; he
believed that Gilbert was gone, and was safely out of
the way for a considerable time to come. Tant would
very gladly have carried the ladies back to London in
due course, there to teach them to forget the existence
of any such person as Gilbert Byfield.</p>

<p>With this object in view, Mr. Jordan Tant,
suspecting that he might be wanted in the business,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
kept out of the way; so that it happened that it was
quite late in the afternoon&mdash;long after repeated
messages had been sent down to the inn to summon
him&mdash;that he put in a sheepish appearance at the
cottage where dwelt Mrs. Ewart-Crane and her
daughter.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ewart-Crane may be said to have seized him
in no uncertain fashion, and to have pointed the way.
He protested and pleaded; but all to no purpose.
Mrs. Ewart-Crane demanded to know what had happened
or was happening; and her dignity forbade
that she should take any active part in the matter
personally. Clearly Jordan Tant was the man sent
by Providence for such a purpose.</p>

<p>So Jordan Tant went&mdash;and Jordan Tant arrived
at the house at the very moment when the whole discovery
had burst upon that house. Mr. Gilbert Byfield
himself, as an apparent visitor, might not have
been missed; but Bessie&mdash;the very head and front of
everything&mdash;and Daniel Meggison, whose dictatorial
tones had been heard everywhere at all times and seasons
in that house; these were the people to be missed
indeed. Mrs. Stocker complained first of discourteous
behaviour on the part of host and hostess; later on
became suspicious that all was not well, and wondered
sarcastically if her brother had gone in search of yet
another fortune. This suggestion she made with an
accompaniment of sniffs and folded hands, and some
pursing of lips.</p>

<p>Still Aubrey Meggison was discreetly silent. He
wanted to find out what had happened, solely on his
own account; he wanted to know what had become
of that father who had so basely deserted him; but on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
the other hand he did not want, as he tersely expressed
it, "a crowd."</p>

<p>Simon Quarle sprang into the very heart of the
matter, strident-tongued and fierce. It was his Bessie
that was concerned, and he passionately swept aside
any suggestion that anyone else might be injured.
Where was she?&mdash;and what was being done?&mdash;those
were the questions to which he demanded an
instant answer&mdash;questions which he shook before the
faces of all with whom he came in contact.</p>

<p>Mr. Tant, coming in the guise of a friend of Mr.
Gilbert Byfield, was seized upon eagerly as someone
having information. What did he know?&mdash;and what
was he prepared to tell? Mr. Tant looked round on
the eager faces, and feeling that for once he held a
position of importance, waved the questioners aside,
and declined to answer.</p>

<p>"I know nothing of Mr. Byfield's movements," he
said. "There certainly has been a suggestion that he
might be leaving here shortly&mdash;but beyond that I
know nothing."</p>

<p>"Does nobody know anything?" wrathfully demanded
Mrs. Stocker, glaring at her husband as
though she fully expected that mild little man to be
hiding important information in his quaking breast.
"Are we all to be treated in this fashion, and no explanations
to be given whatever?"</p>

<p>It was at that moment that the vanity which possessed
Mr. Aubrey Meggison overcame all other feelings,
and demanded to have speech. Aubrey had up
to this moment been ignored; more than that, he had
been ignored by this aristocratic-looking, well-dressed
stranger. He thrust his way into the circle, elbowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
out of it Mr. Edward Stocker, as being the weakest
there, and faced Mr. Jordan Tant.</p>

<p>"Seein' that everybody seems to be at sixes and
sevens, and not quite to know what they're talkin'
about, it mightn't be a bad idea if what I might call
the last representative of the family put in a spoke.
There's a lot of jawin' goin' on&mdash;and yet nobody
seems to know anything at all. If I might say a
word, p'raps I could elucidate what seems to be regarded
as a bit of a mystery, but which ain't, mind
you, any mystery at all."</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;what in the world do <i>you</i> know about
it?" demanded Mrs. Stocker fiercely.</p>

<p>"What I know about it is this," replied Aubrey
calmly, as he drew the note from his pocket, and
flicked at it with a finger. "The guv'nor's taken it
into his head to go&mdash;likewise that sweet sister of
mine; and by all accounts our precious friend Byfield
has gone also. No thought, mind you, of what's
goin' to become of me, or of what I'm to do, left with
this blessed house on my hands. Also to say nothin'
of hints thrown out as to the necessity for me to earn
my own livin'. That's what I know about it."</p>

<p>"I knew it," said Jordan Tant. "I was certain in
my own mind that when it came to the point Byfield
would shake himself free of you all, and go away.
But I certainly did not anticipate that he would take
the girl or her father."</p>

<p>"So you know the truth&mdash;do you?" demanded
Simon Quarle, elbowing his way up to Mr. Tant.
"You know the whole disgraceful truth&mdash;do you?
I suppose you're one of his precious friends&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Byfield is certainly a friend of mine," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
Jordan Tant. "And I am the more sorry that he
seems to have been sponged upon by all sorts of people
with whom he should have had nothing to do."</p>

<p>"Sponged upon!" Mrs. Stocker literally took
him by one shoulder, and turned him round so that
he faced her. "My brother, let me tell you, has a
private fortune of his own&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Private fiddlesticks, ma'am," broke in Simon
Quarle. "He never had a penny to bless himself
with, until he happened to light upon a soft-hearted
man who took an interest in his daughter Bessie.
That soft-hearted man was Gilbert Byfield; and all
this house, and the servants, and the rioting and the
feasting, and the champagne and what not&mdash;it's all
been paid for by him. So much for your brother's
fortune, ma'am!"</p>

<p>"I'll not believe it," exclaimed Mrs. Stocker, seeing
the matter clearly enough now, but clinging to straws.
"It's ridiculous!"</p>

<p>"It happens to be true," said Mr. Tant. "Byfield's
friends have long bewailed this absurd infatuation
of his, and have done their best to get him
away from it; now he has finally defied all their
efforts, and has actually run away with this young
person."</p>

<p>"Regardin' the fact that she's my sister&mdash;would
you wish to offer any explanation of that remark
to me?" asked Aubrey, with dignity.</p>

<p>"Don't forget, my friend, that she has gone with
her father," Simon Quarle reminded Tant in his
harsh voice. "There's not a word can be breathed
against the girl; understand that."</p>

<p>"The only question is&mdash;where have they gone?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
demanded Mrs. Stocker. "Personally, I should like
to see my brother; I should like to let him understand
that never for one instant was I deceived about
the matter; never for one instant did I believe his
tales of this fortune&mdash;and his speculations&mdash;and
so forth. He would find it difficult to deceive me, I
think. I saw through the whole business from the
very beginning."</p>

<p>"All I can tell you is this," said Mr. Tant, turning
towards the door. "Our friend Byfield&mdash;or
perhaps I should say <i>my</i> friend Byfield&mdash;is an extremely
wealthy man, and has a yacht&mdash;the <i>Blue
Bird</i>&mdash;lying at Newhaven. He has gone there, and
will doubtless be found on board by anyone sufficiently
interested in him to follow. So far as I'm concerned&mdash;I
wash my hands of him altogether. Good day
to you!"</p>

<p>Mr. Tant put on his hat, and walked with his little
mincing steps out of the house; from the windows
they saw him going down the drive, and turning out
into the high road. There was a silence for a moment
or two until he had disappeared; then Mrs. Stocker,
in the most startling fashion, demanded of her husband
why he was standing staring there.</p>

<p>"Will you permit me, Edward, to remain any
longer in a house in which I have been insulted&mdash;defrauded&mdash;held
up to ridicule? As you are well
aware, I am compelled to accompany you whenever
I receive orders to do so; such is my wifely duty.
But at the present moment I implore you to take me
away."</p>

<p>"Certainly, my love," said Mr. Stocker feebly.
"Only I should have liked to know what had happened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
to poor Bessie; I always took an interest in the
girl, and I was in a way&mdash;(subject, of course, to
your decision in the matter, my dear)&mdash;quite fond
of her. I should have liked to know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your wife, I believe, stands first," said Mrs.
Stocker, pointing to the door. "I suggest, Edward&mdash;for
of course I would not wish to put my views
before yours&mdash;I suggest that you lead the way, and
that I follow. We can then decide privately what is
best for us to do."</p>

<p>So Mr. Edward Stocker, with a protesting glance
at the others, led the way, and Mrs. Stocker followed.
In the hall, with the door closed, Mrs. Stocker literally
took him by the collar, and after administering
a shake to him, the better to rouse his wits, spoke
her mind.</p>

<p>"Edward Stocker&mdash;I am going after them,"
she said. "I am not going to allow that wretched
brother of mine to triumph in such a manner as this;
I intend to let him know exactly what I think of him.
As for the girl"&mdash;Mrs. Stocker bridled and
breathed hard&mdash;"I fancy I shall have a word to
say to her also when we meet. Edward Stocker&mdash;our
way lies straight for Newhaven and this vessel
called <i>Blue Bird</i>."</p>

<p>"But, my love&mdash;I am not a good sailor," protested
little Mr. Stocker.</p>

<p>"Idiot!&mdash;I don't anticipate a voyage," exclaimed
Mrs. Stocker. "We may be in time to stop them;
that's my idea."</p>

<p>Aubrey Meggison, left with Simon Quarle, looked
at the latter dubiously; and then, in his despair,
decided to seek that gentleman's advice. Simon was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
pacing about the room, with his hands clasped behind
him, and muttering to himself.</p>

<p>"Speakin' of myself for a moment&mdash;what would
you advise?" said Aubrey.</p>

<p>"Advise? What do you mean?" snarled Mr.
Quarle, turning upon him.</p>

<p>"As a man&mdash;and as a brother," said Aubrey a
little feebly. "To say nothing of a being that's been
abandoned, and left to what I might call his fate.
What do you think I ought to do?"</p>

<p>"Do? See if you can find some honest work somewhere&mdash;preferably
road-mending, or something of
that sort," snapped the other; and turned and walked
out of the room.</p>

<p>"Gentlemanly chap, that," said Aubrey, addressing
the furniture. "Road-mendin' indeed! I think
I know a trick worth two of that. If this man Byfield
is so fly with his money, why shouldn't I have a
turn at him? An outraged brother ought to count
for something. Is it to be left to the old man to deal
with him? Not much! Newhaven, wasn't it? I'll
have a look at this blessed <i>Blue Bird</i> on my own account!"
He buttoned his coat with some show of
resolution, and went hurriedly out of the room.</p>

<p>It has to be recorded that Mr. Simon Quarle, on
his knees in his room, hurriedly packing his small
bag, had arrived also at a decision. He was cramming
things in ruthlessly, muttering savagely to himself
as he did so.</p>

<p>"Oh!&mdash;my Bessie&mdash;child in the ways of the
world&mdash;and child most of all where your heart is
touched&mdash;is there anyone that can look after you?
You'll be lost, body and soul, among the lot of 'em,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
if your old friend Simon doesn't stir himself. Devils!&mdash;harpies!&mdash;vultures!&mdash;they
shall reckon with me
when it comes to the pinch. I'm for Newhaven!"</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Jordan Tant had walked straight
back to the cottage, in search of Mrs. Ewart-Crane
and Enid. There, with many gestures, and with the
air of a man whose feelings of right and wrong had
been outraged, he told his story. "If Gilbert had
only listened to me," he ended pathetically&mdash;"but
he never would learn to draw the line."</p>

<p>"One thing I am resolved upon," said Mrs. Ewart-Crane
grimly&mdash;"and that is that poor Gilbert shall
not be absolutely lost. He must be rescued; he must
be snatched away from these people, against his will
if necessary. As I have already hinted, my mind is
pretty well made up; we will go at once to Newhaven,
and see what can be done."</p>

<p>"We?" Enid looked at her mother in bewilderment.</p>

<p>"That was the word I used," said Mrs. Ewart-Crane
sternly. "Jordan, I am sure, would not allow
us to go on such an expedition alone; he will doubtless
be willing to lend us his support&mdash;morally and
physically."</p>

<p>"Certainly&mdash;if you wish it," said Jordan Tant
humbly. "Most delighted. To Newhaven, by all
means."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />

<small>MISS MAKE-BELIEVE WAKES UP</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>IT becomes necessary that we should return to the
deck of that yacht <i>Blue Bird</i>, there to discover
Mr. Daniel Meggison beaming upon Gilbert Byfield,
and inwardly congratulating himself on having once
more stepped straight into the heart of a difficult
and delicate business. We have to imagine the state
of mind of that misguided young man Gilbert, in
once again finding himself saddled with Mr. Daniel
Meggison.</p>

<p>Yet, if the truth be told, there was behind this resentment
some faint sneaking feeling of relief. In
imagination he had gone over scenes that must presently
be enacted on that yacht; and always had come
against a dead wall, beyond which he could not go;
and that dead wall had sprung up hard and firm
whenever he thought of how he must look into the
eyes of Bessie Meggison. He had seen her in many
different moods&mdash;still always in his imagination;
but, to do the man credit, he had seen her always
pure. Which is only another way of saying that
she had always been the girl he had first imagined her
to be.</p>

<p>Shorn of all the romantic element in it, the thing
had painted itself in brutal colours; and Byfield had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
been able to leap the years, as it were, and to see her
in the future. He had set out to do this thing with
the finest motives, and it was not his fault entirely
that his hand had been forced, and that he had been
compelled to take a different course from that he
had at first contemplated; nevertheless he could not
blink the fact that what he was to do now was shameful.
So that the coming of Daniel Meggison, while
it changed every plan he had, yet relieved the situation
of awkwardness; there were to be none of those
scenes between himself and Bessie, when she would
demand an explanation he could not fully give.</p>

<p>Nevertheless (such is the inconsistency of man) he
rebelled at the thought that once again this man
Meggison was to take matters into his own hands,
and to do as he liked, with the unconscious aid of the
girl. Gilbert was quite prepared to end the matter,
and, however, reluctantly, to be done with the whole
business for ever; but he was not prepared to go on
with it under present conditions. The thing resolved
itself into the ridiculous; this carrying away into the
world of Mr. Daniel Meggison, in the absurd frock-coat
and silk hat of his supposed respectability.</p>

<p>Dejectedly enough, Gilbert showed the girl over the
yacht&mdash;Daniel Meggison tailing behind, and expressing
loud approval of everything. Then, so soon
as it could be managed, the young man got rid of
Bessie, and approached the father. For he had determined
that now he would no longer mince matters.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I don't quite understand the position,
Meggison," said Gilbert, standing leaning over the
side while the old man stood beside him. "What do
you imagine I'm going to do; what do you think is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
going to happen, now that you have come here with
Bessie?"</p>

<p>Mr. Daniel Meggison opened wide eyes of virtuous
astonishment. "What am I going to do?" he
echoed. "Is it possible that you imagined, sir, that
I was going to allow my daughter to come here alone?
Is it possible that you thought that her old father
would be so neglectful of her interests as to permit
such a thing? What in the name of all that's moral
did you think I should do?"</p>

<p>That was a poser indeed; Gilbert bit his lip and
said nothing. Mr. Daniel Meggison pursued his advantage
relentlessly.</p>

<p>"My child, sir, has no mother," he went on in a
subdued tone. "I have not been fortunate, Mr. Byfield,
so far as the world is concerned, but yet I have
held up my head. I have been father and mother too
to my girl; she has never been able to complain that
I have not watched over her. Consequently, when
she comes to me, and in the joy of her girlish heart
says to me&mdash;'Father&mdash;I love this man, and this
man loves me'&mdash;I take her to my heart, and I rejoice
with her. Nevertheless, sir"&mdash;Daniel Meggison
wagged his head sternly at the other man&mdash;"nevertheless,
knowing the ways of men, I say to myself
that I must be careful, and I must be watchful.
My suspicions are aroused when I learn that there
is to be a secret stealing away from the house&mdash;with
talk of a yacht&mdash;and a voyage&mdash;and unknown
countries. When my child turns to me, and says
naturally and simply&mdash;'You will of course come
with me, father'&mdash;the tears gather in my eyes, and
I know that all is well. Providence has arranged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
that I am to shepherd my child, after all. And here
I am."</p>

<p>The difficulty lay, of course, in the fact that the
old schemer was absolutely right; out of the lips
of another man his words would have sounded magnificently
indeed. Setting aside the fact that he had
been working for himself, and had followed the girl
simply because she led the way to that gold mine
Daniel Meggison had discovered in his old age, the
man was absolutely right in what he had done, and
Gilbert had no word in reply. But after a moment
or two he turned to Meggison, and said bitterly
enough the only thing he felt he could say.</p>

<p>"Very well, Meggison&mdash;we will grant that you
are right," he said. "But you must understand that
I am not going to carry you about the world for your
own pleasure; I shouldn't think of such a thing.
Since the moment when I did a mad thing for the sake
of this girl you have done your best to drain me; you
have, in fact, announced your intention of living
upon me for the rest of your life. Therefore I'll end
the matter; since I cannot help Bessie without being
preyed on by you for your own purposes, I will not
help her at all. The game is ended; you can go back
to that miserable, shiftless, shifty life you were living
at the time I first met you. Take Bessie away, and
let's put an end to the matter. I've done with it."</p>

<p>Daniel Meggison walked after him, and laid a detaining
hand on his arm. "Not so fast, my young
friend&mdash;not so fast," he urged. "For the sake of
my child, and for the sake of the past, I will overlook
certain references to what you term my miserable,
shiftless, shifty existence; I will swallow that particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
insult, as I have swallowed others. But this
matter cannot be ended in the fashion you suggest.
Nay more&mdash;it shall not be ended."</p>

<p>"We'll see about that," said Gilbert. "I give you
fair warning that you are to get off this boat as soon
as you can possibly manage it; you are to make what
excuses you like to Bessie; and you are not to come
back here, nor to go again to Fiddler's Green. In
fact, so far as Fiddler's Green is concerned, I may
tell you that I have given instructions to the servants
there that your credit is stopped, and that you are
not to be admitted if you go to the place again."</p>

<p>"I guessed as much," said Daniel, with a grin.
"That was one reason why I pursued you here&mdash;because
I really wanted you to understand that you
can't take people up one minute, and drop them the
next, like so many hot potatoes. I did not seek you,
young man; you sought me; consequently you've
got to put up with me. I decline to go."</p>

<p>"You'll think better of it presently," said Gilbert,
turning away helplessly.</p>

<p>"Sir&mdash;I defy you!" said Daniel Meggison, in
a stage whisper, as he ran after the other man.
"You dare not do anything&mdash;because you dare not
tell Bessie. If I wasn't a weakling, without a penny
to bless myself with in the world, I would not shelter
myself behind my child. But you compel me to do
so&mdash;and I am not ashamed. I defy you. You dare
not tell Bessie the truth!"</p>

<p>Gilbert knew only too well that that was strictly
true; he went below, nursing his wrath, and wondering
what had better be done. Mr. Daniel Meggison,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
mildly jubilant, went down below also, in search of
refreshment.</p>

<p>Now that astute servant Pringle had had instructions
that directly the guest expected by Gilbert
arrived the <i>Blue Bird</i> was to start. Consequently he
went below now in search of his master, and finding
him, pointed out that the captain was ready, and only
awaited Gilbert's instructions. Gilbert Byfield, in a
quandary indeed, told the man angrily that he had
changed his mind.</p>

<p>"I'm not going to start yet at all, Pringle," he
said.</p>

<p>"Very good, sir," said Pringle cheerfully. "Expecting
anybody else, sir?"</p>

<p>"The Lord only knows!" exclaimed Gilbert. "I
shouldn't be surprised if everybody else came&mdash;any
number of them. We must wait, at any rate; I won't
start yet."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir," said Pringle; and retired wondering.
"'Shouldn't be surprised if everybody
came.' Wonder what he means?" muttered the man
to himself. "However, it doesn't matter; only it
doesn't look as if we should have a very cheery or
chatty party."</p>

<p>Meanwhile those who were on their way to the yacht
were proceeding as fast as various trains would carry
them. Mrs. Julia Stocker and her husband had discovered
that by taking a route across country they
would avoid the necessity of going to London, and
would arrive at Newhaven very late that night; they
chose that route accordingly. Mr. Aubrey Meggison
made a dash for London, and caught the mail
train down&mdash;as did also Mrs. Ewart-Crane and her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
daughter, piloted by Jordan Tant. As, however, they
had never seen Aubrey (so far, at least, as the ladies
were concerned), and as Mr. Jordan Tant was too
busy even to notice him, it happened that they all
travelled down by the same train together, without
mutual discovery.</p>

<p>Simon Quarle, for his part, was unlucky enough
to miss the mail train, but found on that particular
day that there was another and a slower train, half
an hour later; by that he travelled, on his way to
find that yacht on which all his thoughts were centred.</p>

<p>Now it happened that on that particular night a
dense and heavy white fog, with indeed almost a suggestion
of the "London particular" to add to its
density, settled down upon Newhaven, and upon the
coast for some miles inland, and upon the sea that
washed that coast. A perplexing fog for the summer,
and one not to be accounted for; and it only concerns
us in so far that many strange things were to happen
under the mantle of it. Pringle eyed it with concern,
for it meant that there was no possibility of a start
being made; and Pringle was of a restless disposition,
with a love of the sea that was as incongruous as that
suggestion of humour in his eyes. However, there
was the fog, and they had to make the best of it.</p>

<p>But Pringle was troubled, because he could not
quite understand what was happening, or what was
going to happen. He knew enough of his master
and of that master's moods to know that he must not
question him further; and he had a vague notion
that there might be other people coming to the yacht,
or there might not. Being of a philosophical turn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
of mind, he decided to be prepared for anything that
might happen.</p>

<p>Then, in the most surprising fashion, various people
drifted in, sulkily or suspiciously, out of the fog,
and confronted Pringle. In the first place a lanky
youth, with his hat on the back of his head, and with
a cigarette drooping from the corner of his mouth;
a youth who was anxious to know whether this really
was the yacht <i>Blue Bird</i>, owned by Mr. Gilbert Byfield;
and whether, further, a young lady and an
old gentleman had come on board already. Being
assured as to these points, Mr. Aubrey Meggison instructed
Pringle in a lordly fashion to show him to
a cabin.</p>

<p>"And there's no call for you to mention that I've
arrived; I'll break it to 'em later," said Aubrey.</p>

<p>Next there drifted in out of the night Mrs. Ewart-Crane
and Enid, piloted by the anxious Jordan Tant;
and in this case there was a long consultation on the
quay, while Pringle stood waiting, before they consented
to go on board. And there Mr. Jordan Tant
button-holed Pringle at once, and explained the situation.</p>

<p>"No one is to be disturbed so late as this; Mrs.
Ewart-Crane will choose her own time for an interview
with Mr. Byfield. Let them retire somewhere&mdash;the
ladies, I mean&mdash;and show me some place
where I can be out of the way also. With daylight
the atmosphere will be likely to clear, in more ways
than one."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir," said the obliging Pringle; and
proceeded to accommodate the party without further
delay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>The coming of Mr. and Mrs. Stocker would have
surprised any other man; but Pringle was equal even
to them. He scratched his head a little as he thought
of what the accommodation was; but cheerfully
solved a difficulty that was growing in his mind by
whispering to Mr. Edward Stocker&mdash;"Man and
wife, sir, I presume?"&mdash;and on being assured that
that was the fact, conducting them with some ceremony
and much delicacy to one cabin.</p>

<p>Pringle had finally decided that the vessel was
fairly well stocked, and was discussing the situation
with the captain, when he was hailed for the last time
from the quay; and after preliminaries there descended
to him the square-shouldered figure of Simon
Quarle. Once again Pringle was button-holed, and
once again he proved equal to the emergency.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir&mdash;quite right, sir; young lady and
elderly gentleman. Best not disturb them till the
morning, sir; sunshine an' daylight makes a world
of difference, if the temper is at all 'eated, sir. Mr.
Byfield, sir, wouldn't care to be disturbed, I know.
Cold night, sir, with the fog; could I get you anything,
sir?"</p>

<p>"What you can get me is a bunk of some sort&mdash;some
place I can sleep in," said Simon Quarle, in a
determined voice. "And you need not let anyone
know that I'm here; I'll explain to Mr. Byfield myself
in the morning."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir," replied the smiling but bewildered
Pringle. "This way, sir."</p>

<p>Pringle counted them on his fingers, and shook his
head over them, and decided that they were a little
mixed. Proud of the way in which he had accommodated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
the party, he went on deck, and assured the
captain that it was all right, but that they were "a
rummy lot." Being summoned in a great hurry by
Gilbert Byfield, he discovered that gentleman evidently
in a very fierce and bitter humour, striding
up and down his cabin. Pringle discreetly remained
at the door.</p>

<p>"Oh, Pringle"&mdash;Gilbert turned quickly as the
man appeared&mdash;"let it be understood that we start
as early as possible in the morning&mdash;directly it
clears. Let there be no delay. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir&mdash;perfectly, sir," said Pringle.
He hesitated at the door, and came a step or two into
the cabin. "And&mdash;and the passengers, sir?"</p>

<p>Gilbert of course understood him to refer to Mr.
Daniel Meggison and Bessie; he answered curtly
enough. "They are not to be disturbed; they go
with me," he said.</p>

<p>"Very good, sir," said Pringle, in the hushed tones
of one labouring under deep amazement. "Very
good indeed, sir." Then he vanished.</p>

<p>There were, of course, excellent reasons why the
various members of that extraordinary company
should keep out of each other's way. Mr. Jordan
Tant, in particular, conjured up in a vivid imagination
the wrath of Gilbert Byfield at discovering that
Mrs. Ewart-Crane and her daughter were on board.
The Stockers were too much overawed by their surroundings,
and too much afraid of the result of that
impulsive action taken by Mrs. Julia Stocker, to do
anything but remain in the cabin that had been allotted
to them, a little frightened at what they had
done. Aubrey intended to wait for that moment when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
he could throw himself, as he had done so often, on
the protection of his sister; and Simon Quarle was
fiercely determined to wait until daylight, and then
confront Byfield on his own deck, and have the matter
out with him.</p>

<p>So far as Pringle was concerned, he dared not, of
course, again approach his master; and gradually,
as sleep settled down comfortably on the various passengers,
the fog lifted, and the fair moon shone forth,
and the crew set about preparations for departure.
Presently the engines started, and the <i>Blue Bird</i>
glided out of Newhaven Harbour into the English
Channel, and turned westward. Unexpected journeys
are always tiring; and all those with whom we are
concerned had made unexpected journeys that day.
They slept soundly, lulled to slumber by the throbbing
of the engines, and the sound of the waves
through which they churned their way.</p>

<p>Almost the first of the company to wake in the
morning and to come on deck was Bessie. The <i>Blue
Bird</i> was plunging and tearing through a choppy sea,
but the new sensation was delightful; she had never
experienced anything like it before. New ideas, and
new hopes and desires, seemed to be buffeted into her
by the boisterous wind; above all, it was good to
feel that she was really afloat with Gilbert on this
great sea, and to know also that her father was safely
on board with her. She encountered Gilbert; and
for a moment or two they held hands shyly, the man
forgetting readily enough all that had happened.</p>

<p>"Good morning," she said, ducking her head to
avoid the wind, and laughing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good morning, Bessie mine," he responded.
"You look as fresh as a rose."</p>

<p>"You were not hurt with me for bringing poor
father with me yesterday&mdash;were you?" she asked.
"You see, I couldn't very well come alone&mdash;and poor
father loves the sea; in fact he says that he has an
adventurous spirit that has been kept severely in
check. You didn't mind, did you?"</p>

<p>"I don't mind anything this morning," he assured
her. "All the little cares and troubles and worries
seem to have been left behind in the narrow life that
I have lived; this morning I breathe a freer, better
air, and you are with me; what more could any man
desire? Come to breakfast, my dear; I'm hungry,
if you're not."</p>

<p>In the midst of breakfast Mr. Daniel Meggison
appeared, very much dishevelled, and with a wild and
curious stare in his eyes not to be accounted for by
the mere strangeness of his surroundings. During
the progress of the meal he more than once broke out
into a chuckle of laughter; and then checked himself,
and became amazingly solemn. In the very act of
cracking an egg he stopped, like one haunted, listening;
chuckled again, and then became solemn again;
and made a most surprising remark to Gilbert.</p>

<p>"Byfield&mdash;do you know what I did? It wasn't
drink, because your man only brought me one in the
course of a long and thirsty evening&mdash;and it wasn't
dreams, because I slept soundly. But I"&mdash;he
glanced over his shoulder, and his face became
strangely convulsed again&mdash;"I opened the wrong
cabin door!"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;what of that?" asked Gilbert.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nothing. Nothing at all," said Daniel; and
again became remarkably solemn.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact Daniel Meggison, staggering
along a corridor in the ship that morning, had opened
a cabin door, and had seen that which caused his hair
to rise and his flesh to creep. The vision before him,
in the mere fragment of time before he closed the door
again, was that of Mrs. Julia Stocker, leaning half-way
out of a bunk and groaning; while Mr. Stocker
held on to another bunk with one hand, and endeavoured
to dress himself with the aid of the other, the
while he groaned in concert. Daniel Meggison had
been so alarmed that he had closed the door hurriedly,
and had come away, certain in his own mind that he
had been deceived, and that this was but a mere uneasy
vision.</p>

<p>After breakfast, however, he went down again and
proceeded to explore. Discovering again that cabin,
the door of which he had opened, he once more peered
in, and once more saw the figures of the Stockers;
retreated hurriedly, and began to have a dim idea of
what had happened. He opened another door, and
came upon Simon Quarle, also desperately ill, and too
far gone to take any notice of him; slammed that
door, and stood in the rocking, heaving vessel, striving
to understand what had happened. He was on the
point of further investigation, when Pringle came
delicately and skilfully towards him, balancing a small
tray on which was a glass.</p>

<p>"Morning, sir," said Pringle cheerfully. "A bit
fresh&mdash;isn't it, sir?"</p>

<p>"Too fresh for me," said Daniel Meggison, clutching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
at the man. "Here, I say, my fine fellow&mdash;a
word with you. Who came on board last night?"</p>

<p>Pringle, balancing the tray and watching the glass
upon it, answered deliberately. "Mr. Byfield first,
sir&mdash;and you and the young lady. That's three.
Then a large lady and a small gent&mdash;married&mdash;names
unknown&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stocker. I've seen them," said Daniel. "Was
that all?"</p>

<p>"Oh, by no means, sir," said Pringle cheerfully.
"Two other ladies, and a small gentleman very much
out of breath; another gentleman, tall and thin, that
asked most particular about you and the lady, and
said you wasn't to be disturbed; smoking a cigarette,
that gentleman was, sir."</p>

<p>"Aubrey&mdash;my disgraceful son&mdash;for a thousand
pounds!" said Daniel. "Clever boy, Aubrey; knows
his way about."</p>

<p>"And last, sir, just as I thought we had shipped
the lot of 'em, in a manner of speaking, another gentleman,
with a very loud voice and what I might call
a way of snapping at a man. Square shoulders&mdash;clean
shaven."</p>

<p>"Simon Quarle!" exclaimed Daniel Meggison.
"We've got the whole menagerie!"</p>

<p>"Exactly, sir. Just what occurred to me, sir.
You'll excuse me, sir, I know; lady very ill along
'ere&mdash;the married one."</p>

<p>Daniel Meggison struggled on deck, and tried to
think. By what extraordinary process of events they
had all contrived to follow he did not know; still less
did he understand who the two strange ladies and the
gentleman out of breath might be. He felt, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
that he would wait a little before imparting his knowledge
to anyone else; some old spirit of deviltry that
had long lain dormant in him whispered to him to be
silent, and to await developments.</p>

<p>But for the fact that Pringle was such a very discreet
servant the discovery must have been made long
before it actually was. But Pringle was that admirable
type of servant that told himself he had certain
duties to perform, and was well paid for performing
them, and that nothing else mattered. Consequently
during the next two days he waited upon these new
passengers, prostrate in their cabins, with the most
assiduous care, and said nothing to anyone. Daniel
Meggison stumbled about the ship, hourly expecting
the explosion that must follow the discovery of the
full passenger list; Bessie was blissfully unconscious
of everything, except that she was on the wide sea,
with the man she loved for company.</p>

<p>Gradually, however, the weather changed; and
gradually one by one the white-faced passengers
crept out of their cabins. Pringle, feeling quite certain
in his own mind that his master would welcome
their advent in restored health, bustled about to get
out deck chairs, and generally to make his patients
comfortable. It was destined to be a morning of surprises
for everyone; but Pringle did not know that,
and he was as cheerful as ever as he gradually persuaded
one and another to go up on deck.</p>

<p>It happened that Gilbert was standing alone when
he heard a movement behind him, and turning, saw
the first of the invalids being helped up the companion
by Pringle, who made use of little encouraging
remarks on the way. The patient was Mrs. Stocker,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
who clung to Pringle as she might have clung to her
best friend.</p>

<p>"That's it, ma'am&mdash;you won't know yourself
when you're on deck, and get the breeze. Other foot,
ma'am; that's right&mdash;now here we are, and here's
Mr. Byfield absolutely waitin' for us. If you would
be so kind, sir"&mdash;this to the amazed Gilbert&mdash;"if
you would be so kind, sir, as to take the lady's other
arm, I could get her to the chair there in a mere matter
of winking. That's it, ma'am; take your time
from us&mdash;asking the master's pardon."</p>

<p>"What&mdash;in the name of all that's marvellous&mdash;&mdash;"
Gilbert was staring at the woman who
clutched him, and was quite mechanically stepping
along the deck in the direction indicated.</p>

<p>"I can explain everything," said Mrs. Stocker.
"I came on account of my niece; I have suffered
severely for my devotion. I am suffering now."</p>

<p>"The gentleman, sir, said he'd find his way up
alone," said Pringle. "It's taken it out of the gentleman
a lot, sir; much more frail than the lady, sir.
Talkin' of angels!&mdash;here he is, sir."</p>

<p>"Beautiful vessel, sir," murmured poor Edward
Stocker, getting discreetly a little behind Pringle.
"Most sorry to have been ill on the premises, as I
might say, sir; it doesn't seem exactly grateful for
privileges&mdash;does it, sir?"</p>

<p>Gilbert walked past him, and accosted Pringle, who
now for the first time began to look doubtful. "How
did these people come on board, Pringle?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," said the man&mdash;"they&mdash;they just
came. Asked for you, sir, and seemed as if they knew
they were expected, and&mdash;and here they are, sir.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
Every one who came on board seemed to know you,
and seemed to think they'd be expected, sir."</p>

<p>"Every one? How many more?"</p>

<p>"Five more, sir&mdash;only five. Two ladies, and a
gentleman with them&mdash;and two separate gents that
tumbled in without appearing to know each other,
sir."</p>

<p>"But why did you let them stop&mdash;and who the
deuce are they?" demanded Gilbert angrily.</p>

<p>"If you please, sir, you'll remember I asked you
if any more was expected, and the remark you made,
sir, was (askin' your pardon, of course, sir)&mdash;'The
Lord only knows!' In fact, you seemed to think,
sir, that all sorts of people might be droppin' in.
Consequently, sir, when they did arrive I made 'em
as comfortable as I could, and I've waited on 'em
simply 'and and foot ever since. Very ill they've been
indeed, sir."</p>

<p>From that moment the passengers may be said to
have emerged gradually and with caution. Mr. Tant
came on deck with something of a scared look, and
seemed appalled to find himself on the open sea;
seized by Gilbert, he blurted out something of what
had happened.</p>

<p>"It's no use bullying me," he said, in an aggrieved
fashion. "I didn't bring them; they brought me.
Thank your stars that you've got a man on board in
case of emergencies. Enid and her mother were both
frantically anxious about you, and simply insisted
on coming straight away to the yacht; though why
on earth you wanted to bring 'em away to sea beats
me."</p>

<p>"I didn't even know they were on board," exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
Gilbert furiously. "It's simply monstrous that I
should be followed about in this fashion. I understand
there are five of you, besides those I've already
discovered; who are the other two?"</p>

<p>"How should I know?" retorted Tant crossly.
"You've taken an interest in so many people, and
have adopted families wholesale, that you ought to
know better than I do. Where's that man of yours?
I'm ravenously hungry for the first time in three days.
This is a beastly vessel for pitching."</p>

<p>As he went away sounds of a struggle and of
heated voices floated to Gilbert from below; and a
moment or two later Simon Quarle struggled on deck,
grasping by the collar Aubrey Meggison, whom he
was dragging in triumph with him. Aubrey was protesting
feebly, and endeavouring under trying circumstances
to sustain his dignity.</p>

<p>"Come out&mdash;stowaway!" exclaimed Simon excitedly.
"Another hanger-on&mdash;another creature
sneaking behind a woman's skirts, and shirking the
honest work he ought to do. Come on deck and show
yourself!"</p>

<p>"So you are the other two&mdash;are you?" asked
Gilbert. "May I ask what brings you here, Mr.
Quarle?"</p>

<p>"You may&mdash;and you shall be answered," said
Simon Quarle sturdily. "I come to have an explanation
with you&mdash;and I come also to set a few matters
straight. I didn't expect to be carried away to sea
like this&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You're not the only one," said Gilbert, with a
smile. "All your followers are here&mdash;all the people
with whom you have associated yourself. There's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
quite a ship's load of them&mdash;of all sorts and sizes
and qualities!"</p>

<p>Even in such an amazing business as this a crisis
had to be reached; all the many threads had to be
gathered together. That crisis was reached when
Bessie presently came along the deck, accompanied by
her father; when she stared with amazement at Mrs.
Julia Stocker and Mr. Stocker, reposing in deck
chairs; when she encountered her brother, disposed
to be affectionate from sheer terror of what might
happen to him; and when she was finally received into
the arms of Simon Quarle with a friendly hug.</p>

<p>"Don't you be afraid, Bessie," said Quarle. "I
came on board on purpose to look after you; no one
shall do you any harm. You've got one friend in the
world, at least."</p>

<p>"I seem to have a great many friends," said Bessie,
looking round at them. "Father, dear&mdash;you
and Mr. Byfield have been arranging a surprise for
me; you've brought all our friends together, even
here. Here's dear Aubrey&mdash;and Aunt Julia and
Uncle Ted, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So this is the girl&mdash;is it?" It was an unfriendly
voice, and it proceeded from Mrs. Ewart-Crane, who
had that moment climbed to the deck accompanied by
her daughter. From an unfinished breakfast Jordan
Tant had also appeared; so that they were all gathered
about her on that deck, with the friendly arms
of Simon Quarle round her; her troubled eyes were
turned upon Gilbert.</p>

<p>"I did not expect to see you here," said Gilbert
slowly to Mrs. Ewart-Crane. "Perhaps now you'll
explain what it is you want?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>"We've been carried to sea quite against our will,
and in deplorable weather," said Enid. "May I ask
if this is the young lady who is the cause of all this
trouble and disturbance?" she asked, looking at
Bessie.</p>

<p>"Don't you mind, my dear; I'm close to you,"
growled Simon Quarle.</p>

<p>"This is Miss Bessie Meggison," said Gilbert.</p>

<p>"Gilbert and I are very glad to see you," said Bessie,
still watching Byfield, but speaking bravely.
"Gilbert has been good enough to take us all away
on his beautiful yacht; I didn't know there was going
to be such a large party. Why do you all look at me
so strangely&mdash;why won't someone speak to me?"</p>

<p>"Don't take any notice of 'em; keep a brave heart,
child," growled Simon Quarle in the same fashion as
before.</p>

<p>"I certainly think it's time, Byfield, that some
proper explanation was made," said Tant, adjusting
himself with difficulty to the rolling of the vessel.
"It's a mad business from beginning to end; but it
seems to me Miss Meggison is the only one that
doesn't understand it."</p>

<p>"She understands all that is necessary," broke in
Daniel Meggison fiercely. "She trusts her poor old
father, and she knows where her best friends are.
Come, now&mdash;what if we all go to breakfast? or at
all events get some refreshment of some sort?
Splendid notion!"</p>

<p>"Mr. Byfield has asked us to sail with him on his
yacht," said Bessie steadily. "What explanation is
needed? My father and I would never have come
away from England like this, but that my father had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
a fortune, and was able suddenly to make up for many
years of hardship and misery. I would have liked to
stay at Fiddler's Green for ever."</p>

<p>"You don't seem to understand that the house at
Fiddler's Green belonged to Mr. Byfield," broke in
the cold voice of Mrs. Ewart-Crane.</p>

<p>"Borrowed by me under a special arrangement,"
persisted Daniel Meggison. "Why don't we all go to
breakfast?"</p>

<p>"Lent to your father by Mr. Byfield, because for
some absurd reason he thought it might be well for
you, who had lived all your life in a poverty-stricken
district of London, to have a taste of the country,"
said Enid. "Will the girl never understand?"</p>

<p>"Bear it bravely; keep a stiff upper lip before 'em
all!" urged Simon Quarle, in a growling undertone.
"We'll get you out of this muddle with clean hands
yet."</p>

<p>"Mr. Byfield&mdash;won't you tell me what it all
means?" asked Bessie.</p>

<p>"I never meant that you should know the truth,"
said Gilbert. "I played a game of make-believe, just
as you had done; your father's fortune was make-believe
too. God knows you've been welcome to anything
I've been able to do for you; we'd have been
happy enough but for all the meddlers and muddiers
who have been about us. Now you know the truth."</p>

<p>"There was never any fortune&mdash;never any money,
except what you gave us?" she said slowly, looking at
Byfield. "All the rest is lies&mdash;and pretence&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Only make-believe, Bessie," said Gilbert gently.</p>

<p>"There's no more make-believe for me!" she exclaimed,
with a sudden new fierceness. "I'm not a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
child any more." Then suddenly breaking down, she
looked at them appealingly, with eyes swimming with
tears. "Won't you turn your faces from me?" she
pleaded. "Don't you see that I am shamed and mean
and horrible? For pity's sake turn your faces away
from me!"</p>

<p>She turned her own then, and hid it on the friendly
breast of Simon Quarle.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />

<small>MISERY MAKES STRANGE BOAT-FELLOWS</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>IN that sudden strange finding of the truth there
was no degradation for the girl; the degradation
was for those who had deceived her. Even Mrs.
Ewart-Crane&mdash;hard woman of the world that she
was&mdash;seemed to understand that, and however contemptuous
she might be for the amazing innocence of
Bessie, she yet seemed to know it for innocence, nevertheless.
With a shrug of the shoulders she was the
first to make a move to leave the girl and Gilbert
together for that explanation that seemed to be demanded;
the others followed suit, a little sheepishly&mdash;Daniel
Meggison and Quarle the last to go.</p>

<p>"For my part," said Daniel, looking round, and
speaking with an air of great frankness, "I cannot
for the life of me see what all the fuss is about. If a
good fellow likes to perform a generous action&mdash;what's
to prevent him? I hate all this over-squeamishness."</p>

<p>"The less <i>you</i> say the better for everyone," said
Simon Quarle, elbowing him out of the way. "You
and your precious son are responsible for all this
trouble; and I've been a weak-kneed idiot not to have
put a stop to your games long ago."</p>

<p>"You can leave the precious son out of it, mister,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
said Aubrey, looking back over his shoulder. "Whatever
I've done doesn't concern anybody else; and what
father's done has been on account of the family. You
never having had a family ain't likely to understand
what such a man's feelings may be."</p>

<p>Simon Quarle would have turned back at the last;
but he saw that the girl was standing straight and
quiet, with her hands clasped before her, staring out
at the sea, and evidently waiting until she could speak
to Gilbert Byfield alone. Gilbert, for his part,
watched the girl furtively, wondering a little what she
would say or what she would do.</p>

<p>"Bessie," he said at last gently&mdash;"have you nothing
to say to me?"</p>

<p>She did not look at him; she strove hard to keep
her voice steady. "How long will it take us to get
back?" she asked.</p>

<p>"To get back?" He looked at her quickly.</p>

<p>"To England. Don't you see for yourself how
utterly helpless I am?" she demanded passionately,
with a note in her voice he had not heard before.
"I am a prisoner here; I cannot stir hand or foot to
get away from you. Put me on shore&mdash;anywhere&mdash;and
I will walk, if necessary, to get back to London."</p>

<p>"This is rank madness!" he exclaimed. "For
Heaven's sake, Bessie, be reasonable, and let us face
the situation fairly and squarely. What harm have
I done you?"</p>

<p>"What harm?" She faced him suddenly, with her
hands clenched, and with eyes that yet had the tears
in them blazing at him. "What harm? Don't you
understand&mdash;or won't you understand&mdash;that in all
my life no one has ever been able to say that I didn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
fight my own way&mdash;for myself and others; no one
has been able to say that even in my poor fashion I
didn't hold up my head&mdash;proud to think that I had
never looked to anyone for a shilling. And you&mdash;you
of all men on earth&mdash;have been"&mdash;she turned
away her head, with the swift colour mounting in her
face&mdash;"you have kept me!"</p>

<p>"Bessie!"</p>

<p>"It's true!" she flashed at him. "You've lied to
me in everything&mdash;fed me with smooth words, just as
you've fed me and the others with food you paid for.
The clothes I wear have been bought with your money&mdash;and
I would rather stand naked before you than
have to say it."</p>

<p>"I tell you you don't understand," he pleaded.
"It was done for your sake&mdash;and for your sake only.
I was rich&mdash;and I saw a chance to help you, a mere
child, and to bring some light and joy into your life.
It was nothing to me; and you had longed, naturally
enough, for things far beyond your reach. I tell you
I was glad to do it."</p>

<p>"I understand perfectly," she said, standing close
to him, and looking at him fearlessly. "I was a toy&mdash;something
that amused you&mdash;a child you were
sorry for. You didn't see that behind the child was
the woman, who could be shamed and outraged and
hurt; you never thought of that. It pleased you to
spend money&mdash;because money was nothing to you,
and was the easiest thing you had to part with. And
then, to crown it all&mdash;the bitterest blow of all&mdash;you
lied to me, and told me that you loved me."</p>

<p>"Stop!" he cried hastily. "You're wrong there;
I swear it. I did love you&mdash;and I do love you; you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
are more wonderful to me than any woman I have
ever met. I've been a brute and a fool, and I haven't
understood; but I understand now, and I love you
a thousand times more than I ever did before. I've
blundered on, not troubling about you, or what became
of you; content only to let each day go on&mdash;happy
in keeping you in ignorance. There are no
words bad enough to paint what I've done; but what I
said to you was true then when I said it, and is more
than ever true now."</p>

<p>She laughed, and flung up her head with a little
quick gesture. "I don't believe it," she said&mdash;"but
even if it's true it happens that at least I can spare
myself something&mdash;can keep some little shred of
self-respect to cover me. I hate you; when I said
that I loved you it was wrong, and it wasn't true. I
never want to see you again; I never want to have
anything to do with you again. Some day, when I've
fought and striven a little, I'll be able to pay you
back what I've had from you; I shall work for that
through all the years that are coming to me&mdash;I shall
think only of that. That's my last word, Mr. Byfield.
Now, if you have any feeling left at all, you will go
away, and will let me alone until you can put me on
shore. I don't want to stay here longer than I can
help," she added, her voice breaking a little&mdash;"because
there are so many people on this yacht who
know all about it, and must be laughing at me."</p>

<p>He saw the utter hopelessness of arguing the matter
with her; he turned away. At the same time there
was, naturally enough, in his mind a bitter feeling of
resentment that the matter should have ended in this
way; for after all it must be remembered that, even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
with that mad impulse which had started the business,
the mad impulse had been a good one, and had only
been thwarted by others. The man had done his best,
however mistakenly, and he bitterly resented the very
natural attitude the girl took up. He was chafing
with futile rage at the position in which he found
himself, and in which he had placed her, when her
voice recalled him.</p>

<p>"Mr. Byfield&mdash;you have not told me how soon we
can go back," she reminded him coldly. "Surely you
understand that I have done with all this"&mdash;she
gave a comprehensive sweep of her hands to indicate
the yacht and all about it&mdash;"and that I want to
get back to some such sort of Arcadia Street as that
in which you found me."</p>

<p>He came slowly back to her; he looked at her
steadily. "I'm not going back," he said. "You
don't understand that, whatever I may have done, and
however mistaken I may be, you're treating me very
unfairly. I'll change nothing to which I've set my
hand; I'll go back in my own good time. These other
people came on board for their own purposes; I'll not
be at the beck and call of anyone now that those purposes
are finished. I've done everything for the best,
and whether I have failed or not doesn't affect the
matter. More than that, although you won't listen to
me I love you, and I don't mean to give you up. It's
you and I, Bessie, against the world, and against all
these other people; you shan't go back to any Arcadia
Street if I can help it."</p>

<p>"I'll find my own way back," she exclaimed passionately.
"I have nothing further to do with you; you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
don't touch my life at all. You must take me back to
England."</p>

<p>"I will not," he replied obstinately; and with those
final words left her.</p>

<p>Strange as it may appear, for two whole days the
situation remained unchanged. Gilbert held practically
no communication with anyone on board, save
with Bessie, to whom occasionally he sent a note by
the discreet hands of Pringle. But though she read
the notes, and though over the first of them at least
she wavered a little, she never sent any reply, and the
notes themselves, in fragments, were tossed overboard.
But on the evening of the second day after that disclosure
of the truth, Mr. Tant literally forced his way
into the presence of Gilbert, and demanded to know
what was going to happen.</p>

<p>"My dear Gilbert," he exclaimed&mdash;"I can really
stand it no longer. Mrs. Ewart-Crane, fortunately
for all of us (though Heaven forgive me for saying
so) has been extremely ill again, or she would in all
probability have demanded to see you; Enid, I regret
to say, has merely become sulky. Don't think that I
blame her for a moment; in her position anyone might
be excused for doing the same. The other people do
not concern me, and so I have not troubled about
them; but I would merely observe that the elder
Meggison appears to be making a frantic attempt to
drink himself to death, thanks to the services of the
obliging Pringle. Something's got to be done&mdash;and
quickly."</p>

<p>"There is one person in command of this vessel,
and of the situation," replied Gilbert. "That person
is Miss Meggison; and when she deigns to look at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
matter from the proper standpoint, and practically
to take no notice of any of those persons who have
forced their way on to the yacht, we shall know what
we are going to do. I am perfectly comfortable, and
unless Miss Meggison moves in the matter the situation
must solve itself."</p>

<p>So Mr. Jordan Tant, shaking his head desolately,
went off to find Bessie. As a matter of fact he was
a little afraid of her, because of the extraordinary
position that a girl of her origin had taken up; it was
clearly against anything he had ever understood concerning
people of her class. He approached her in
the politest fashion, and pleaded with her to do something
in the matter.</p>

<p>"I have been speaking to our friend Byfield, Miss
Meggison," said Mr. Tant&mdash;"and I may be said to
be a sort of reluctant ambassador. Personally I do not
like the sea; there is not that stability about it that I
require for my actual comfort; if you come to that,
I think none of us here really like the sea; we should
all like to go back safely to dry land. Now&mdash;what
do you say?"</p>

<p>"I have already told Mr. Byfield that I want to
go back to England," said Bessie.</p>

<p>"Excellent! I am sure that our friend Byfield does
not really understand the situation. Perhaps you
have not explained the matter clearly."</p>

<p>"I have explained it very clearly&mdash;but Mr. Byfield
absolutely refuses to go back," said Bessie.
"The matter is not in my hands, as you appear to
think; I am a prisoner here just the same as you are.
Here is my father; perhaps you had better speak to
him about it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>"Personally I don't see that there's anything to
discuss," said Daniel Meggison, airily stepping into
the conversation. "Our good friend Byfield&mdash;owner
of this charming yacht&mdash;prefers as an idle man to
take a cruise on summer seas. I, as another idle man,
am delighted to accompany him&mdash;and my daughter
is included in the party. I confess there are certain
people on board who have forced themselves, as it
were, into the original scheme of things; but the vessel
is a large one, and we may safely ignore them. Personally,
I'm very comfortable, and I decline to question
the motives of my friend Byfield in any way.
Excellent fellow, Byfield&mdash;lavish with his money."</p>

<p>"You hear what my father says," said Bessie, with
a little note of contempt in her voice. "Surely you
can want nothing else. I don't count at all, you see;
all the other people have to be reckoned with first."</p>

<p>Mr. Tant went away, but did not return to Gilbert.
Instead he spent some hours in going about between
Mrs. Ewart-Crane and Enid and Simon Quarle&mdash;putting
questions to them, with his head very much
on one side, and speaking always in a plaintive tone.
Those questions resolved themselves simply into&mdash;What
ought a fellow to do under certain exasperating
circumstances?&mdash;Wouldn't it be better to appoint a
committee, or something of that kind, to take charge
of things? Failing to get any satisfaction from any
quarter, Mr. Tant took his sorrows to the cheerful
Pringle, who seemed to suggest that there was nothing
very much to worry about.</p>

<p>"Bless you, sir&mdash;so long as you're in comfortable
quarters I don't think it matters much, sir, whether
you're afloat or whether you're ashore. You've got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
to pass the time somehow, and you may as well make
the best of things as they happen along, sir. Nice
vessel, sir&mdash;an' company nice and varied; some of
'em swears at you, an' some of 'em complains about
things&mdash;an' nobody seems just at the moment to be
absolutely wild with joy. But Lor', sir, anything
might happen to cheer everybody up at a moment's
notice. Anything I can do for you, sir?"</p>

<p>Mr. Tant went away, feeling more miserable than
ever. Coming on deck, he found that it was growing
dark, and that a soft uncomfortable rain was falling;
the wind had dropped to nothing. He wondered despondently
where they were, or for what port they
were bound; he had not troubled to ask about such
matters as that at all. Finally he went below, and
curled himself up in a corner of the saloon, and went
to sleep.</p>

<p>He was awakened from that sleep by a sudden
violent shock that flung him full upon his face upon
the carpet. He scrambled up, hearing above him a
great noise of running feet, and the shouts of men,
and once the agitated scream of a woman. He got the
door of the saloon open, and went off along a corridor
that seemed to slope in an unaccountable fashion in
search of Mrs. Ewart-Crane's cabin. He met Enid at
the door of it.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" she asked. "Everything
in the cabin seems to be upside down."</p>

<p>"I don't know," responded Mr. Tant, with his
teeth chattering&mdash;"but I should say that we'd
bumped into something."</p>

<p>Mr. Tant left her, and went along that corridor
that sloped unpleasantly on his way to the deck. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
the foot of the companion he collided with Pringle,
who apologized, and beamed upon him as cheerfully
as ever.</p>

<p>"Shouldn't be a bit surprised, sir, if we wasn't all
goin' to the bottom," said Pringle, with a grin.
"This way, sir; take my arm, sir."</p>

<p>They scrambled on deck in a pitchy darkness of
fog and a blur of rain, to see dim figures moving
swiftly about the deck, and to hear a voice above them
crying orders. The deck sloped as much as the
corridor had done, and at quite as unpleasant an
angle; somewhere near at hand they heard Gilbert's
voice speaking sharply to the captain.</p>

<p>"It means taking to the boats, sir," shouted the
voice above. "Plenty of time, if things are done
quietly; the men are all standing by. Better get your
friends on deck, sir."</p>

<p>That suggestion was more easily made than carried
out. Mrs. Stocker, for instance, was in a great state
of hysteria, and was clinging to little Mr. Stocker,
something to his suffocation. She insisted upon being
taken on deck, and at the same time vigorously resisted
every effort to get her there. Mr. Daniel
Meggison wept, and wrung his hands, and bawled for
life-belts; Aubrey, with all the bravado gone out of
him, stood still, and plucked at his lips, and stared
into the blackness of the night, terror-stricken. Mrs.
Ewart-Crane and her daughter clung together; but
Enid, to do her justice, was quite composed, and spoke
sharply once to Mr. Tant when that gentleman demanded
to know if anybody was ever going to do
anything.</p>

<p>Simon Quarle found the hand he wanted in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
darkness, and gripped it. "Well, Bessie&mdash;are you
afraid?" he whispered.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;not afraid," she said steadily. "If only
father would be quiet; we can't do any good by
shouting."</p>

<p>"Life-belts!" bellowed Daniel Meggison. "Oh&mdash;my
God!&mdash;are there no life-belts on this rotten old
hulk? Life-belts!"</p>

<p>The yacht was settling down slowly but steadily;
there was nothing for it but to take to the boats.
Some provisions were put in&mdash;the men hurrying
hither and thither, answering cheerfully to the orders
given them, and standing in their places without disorder.
The only confusion was among the passengers;
when their boat was at last ready, Daniel and
his son scuffled together feebly for a moment or two,
even with blows, in an attempt to get into the boat
first.</p>

<p>Now, just how it happened that in the confusion
that boat went off with the passengers only in it&mdash;the
Stockers and the Ewart-Cranes, the Meggisons
and Quarle, and Tant and Gilbert&mdash;will never be
known. At the last moment Gilbert called out to
know if Pringle was there; and the cheery voice of the
man answered him; and Pringle, following the voice,
stepped into his place.</p>

<p>"Nice smooth sea, sir," said Pringle, as he took
an oar.</p>

<p>The other boats were being manned; to the last,
as they pulled away, they heard the steady voice of
the captain calling orders. Gilbert and Pringle and
Simon Quarle pulled steadily; the women were huddled
in the stern, and one of them at least was whimpering.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
Gradually the night seemed to close in above them
and about them; gradually it seemed that they were
left more and more alone on the gently heaving sea.
At last&mdash;minutes after, as it seemed&mdash;there was a
sound of rending and tearing upon rocks&mdash;and then
a splash of waters; then all was still.</p>

<p>"She's gone," said Gilbert, drawing a long breath.</p>

<p>They pulled slowly, waiting for the dawn; no one
seemed inclined to speak. Daniel Meggison slumbered
a little, murmuring in his sleep; Mrs. Julia Stocker
also appeared to sleep, pillowing her head upon Mr.
Stocker, who seemed to strive to make her as comfortable
as he could. She murmured more than once of
Clapham.</p>

<p>Gilbert strove to pierce the darkness to catch a
glimpse of Bessie. He thought he knew where she sat&mdash;upright
and slim and steady; he wondered of what
she was thinking, out there in the darkness&mdash;remembered
with a pang how far she was from that quiet
Arcadia Street in which he had found her. Then
gradually, from sheer exhaustion, he nodded a little
himself, even while he kept his oar moving rhythmically.
And the dawn grew at last in the sky, and
shed its grey light upon them&mdash;that strange little
company in an open boat upon the sea.</p>

<p>That little company woke gradually to the full
meaning of their situation. Mrs. Stocker, shuddering,
was absolutely certain that she "looked a fright";
Mr. Edward Stocker passed a sort of damp compliment
to her concerning her appearance. Mrs. Ewart-Crane
had withdrawn herself a little, with her daughter,
from the commoner company; Enid might have
been observed holding the hand of Jordan Tant.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
Daniel Meggison, for his part, more than once put
the lives of them all in peril by standing up in the
boat, holding on to the person nearest him, and declaring
that he distinctly saw land; after such an
exhibition he was usually hauled down unceremoniously
by the coat-tails by his son.</p>

<p>"Got any notion where we are?" growled Simon
Quarle over his shoulder to Gilbert.</p>

<p>"Not the slightest," replied Byfield in the same
tone. "As a matter of fact, I didn't trouble very
much about the direction we were taking during the
past few days."</p>

<p>"Then we must hope for luck&mdash;and cheer up the
women," said Quarle, bending to his oar again.</p>

<p>"It might help a bit, sir, if I was to serve out
breakfast," said Pringle, looking back over his
shoulder. "It isn't much, sir; but it might well be
less. At the worst, it'll keep us going for a day or
two, sir."</p>

<p>"Go ahead then&mdash;but be sparing," said Gilbert.</p>

<p>"Very good, sir," replied Pringle cheerfully; and
proceeded to hand out miscellaneous provisions forthwith.</p>

<p>"I feel that I am a citizen of the world," said
Daniel Meggison, biting a biscuit, and looking round
upon his fellow-voyagers. "Anything might happen
to me&mdash;anything may happen; but at least I shall
have warmed both hands at the fire of life."</p>

<p>"That's about the only fire you ever will warm
your hands at, Dad, I should think," retorted Aubrey.
"Beastly chilly on the sea at this time of the morning."
He flogged himself viciously with his arms as
he spoke. "Besides, how anybody can be cheerful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
under these horrible circumstances licks me. Biscuits&mdash;and
tinned things&mdash;and water!"</p>

<p>"Water is certainly a drawback, but I believe
thirst is even worse," said Mr. Meggison.</p>

<p>"If Mr. Stocker and I were at home now we should
at least be having a comfortable breakfast," said Mrs.
Stocker, shivering. "I do hope that girl is looking
after the house; ten chances to one she won't have
dusted the place since last I set foot in it. I wonder
what'll happen if we all go to the bottom of the sea?
I wonder if she'll stop at the house, and hope for us
to come back."</p>

<p>"Let us hope, on our own accounts, that we shall go
back, my dear," said Mr. Stocker. "After all, we're
not the worst off by any means," he added, lowering
his voice. "Mr. Byfield, for instance&mdash;think what
he's lost. All that great vessel gone to the bottom of
the sea."</p>

<p>"Well, he ought to have had more sense than to go
tearing over the ocean, and bumping into things in
the dark the way he did," snapped Mrs. Stocker.</p>

<p>"I don't know whether you noticed, ma'am," said
Daniel Meggison genially, as he turned to Mrs.
Ewart-Crane, "that about a fortnight ago, in one of
the Sunday papers, there was an account of a shipwrecked
crew&mdash;provisions exhausted&mdash;who decided
to draw lots as to which of them should be killed to
provide sustenance for the remainder. It fell to the
cook&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I do not read the Sunday papers, sir," said Mrs.
Ewart-Crane, turning her back upon him.</p>

<p>"That's a pity," he retorted, nothing abashed.
"They seemed to find the cook somewhat reluctant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
but finally overcame his scruples, and were just deciding
how best to dispose his person among the
crew&mdash;to divide him up, in fact, ma'am&mdash;when there
was a cry from one of the number that a vessel was in
sight. So the cook escaped. Highly interesting
narrative, ma'am."</p>

<p>"Even in the small compass of this boat, sir, you
will find that it is more convenient to draw the line, if
I may use the expression, between class and class,"
said Mr. Jordan Tant icily. "Because a lady is compelled
to sit upon the same seat with you in a boat on
the open sea is no reason why you should force your
conversation upon her. It isn't done, sir."</p>

<p>"Confound your impudence!" exclaimed Daniel
Meggison, starting to his feet. But Aubrey promptly
pulled him down again, and he retired, muttering,
into the depths of his large frock-coat, the collar of
which he had turned up about his ears.</p>

<p>A mist had settled down again over the sea. They
pulled on and on steadily, with no definite purpose in
their minds as to what was to happen to them. But
presently, amid a silence that had fallen upon them all
(for even Daniel Meggison had given up conversation
as hopeless under the circumstances), Gilbert leaned
forward and spoke to Simon Quarle.</p>

<p>"I can hear the sound of waves breaking on rocks,"
he said. "I thought I heard it just now; but now I'm
certain."</p>

<p>They rested upon their oars, and listened; the sound
was unmistakable. Everyone sat up, and began to
offer suggestions as to where they were, and what the
land was likely to be; the three rowers settled again
to their work. And now the sound grew louder and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
louder, until presently, jutting up out of the mist,
was a grey shadow that was certainly land&mdash;a grey
shadow that presently resolved itself into a sloping
shore, with white crested waves breaking upon it.
They pulled cautiously, looking for an opening;
Daniel Meggison was with difficulty restrained from
leaping to his feet and shouting.</p>

<p>"For my part, I do hope there'll be somebody that
can speak the English language," said Mrs. Stocker.
"Also I hope there won't be any unnecessary bumping
when we do land. I remember when I was a girl
at Brighton when we were run up on the beach in a
very nice boat&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The speech was cut short by the boat that moment
taking ground gently; the three men sprang out, and
began to haul it up on the sloping shore. One by one
the cramped passengers were handed out over the
seats; they stood on a desolate shore, without any
sign of human habitation anywhere, and looked about
them forlornly.</p>

<p>"Looks to me very much like an island, sir," said
Pringle cheerfully.</p>

<p>"By all the rules of the game it certainly ought to
be an island," said Daniel Meggison.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br />

<small>THE CASTAWAYS</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>THE first business of the shipwrecked party,
after hauling up the boat and taking out of it
the various stores it contained, was to make some attempt
at exploring the place upon which they had
been so unceremoniously flung. That is true, at least,
of the more energetic members, practically consisting
of Gilbert Byfield, and Simon Quarle and Pringle.</p>

<p>Daniel Meggison and his son, together with Mr.
Tant, were left to guard the ladies against those unknown
dangers which in this strange place might
threaten them; Mrs. Stocker had already declared
that she had "heard savages"&mdash;but declined to
enter into particulars regarding what particular noise
she referred to. So in the grey morning mist Julia
Stocker and her husband, and Mrs. Ewart-Crane and
her daughter, seated themselves upon the shore, and
Daniel Meggison and his son with Mr. Tant stood
ready to hurl themselves upon any approaching foe.</p>

<p>Byfield and his two companions had set off round
the shore; and they had scarcely gone fifty yards
when out of the mists they had left behind there came
towards them, crying to them, someone running.
Gilbert stood still, and even went back a few paces;
and so came face to face with Bessie. She caught at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
his hand, and for a moment it seemed as though the
old friendly confidence was restored between them.</p>

<p>"I want to go with you," she panted.</p>

<p>"Come along then," he responded quickly; and
they moved on to join the others.</p>

<p>"We mustn't make up our minds that the place is
an island until we've made the circuit of it," said
Simon Quarle as they went on. "Romantic notions
are one thing&mdash;but we may be quite near to civilization."</p>

<p>"It only shows, sir, what a wonderful thing
schooling is," said Pringle, pausing for a moment,
and speaking with the utmost respect. "Now when
I was a nipper,&mdash;boy I mean, sir&mdash;I was only too
glad to cut what lessons I could, sir. But suppose,
for instance, I hadn't had it well rubbed into me that
an island was a piece of land entirely surrounded by
water&mdash;I might have got into quite a muddle over
this. Shouldn't have known, sir, how to set about it
to find out if it really <i>was</i> an island. Wonderful
thing education, sir."</p>

<p>By means of a pocket compass which dangled on
the watchchain of Simon Quarle they discovered first
that they were going due south, and then that they
were turning towards the west. It was at about the
most western point of the island that they found that
the character of the land changed, and that from
some low hills a deep wood stretched down almost to
the shore. Skirting this, and turning northward,
they found their further progress barred by a great
chain of rocks that rose abruptly from the more level
ground and plunged also straight out into the sea. It
was obviously impossible for them any longer to keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
to the coast; they skirted this line of rocks inland, and
came in a comparatively short time again to the sea.
This time the coast pointed southwards; following it,
they came to the boat drawn up on the beach, and to
the little company of people they had left.</p>

<p>"I see exactly the shape of this place," said Simon
Quarle, rapidly scraping out a rough design on the
sand. "It is pear-shaped, with the narrowest part of
the pear (where the stalk would be) to the north, and
the broadest part of it running from east to west.
There is only one question we've left unsettled; what
is beyond those rocks?"</p>

<p>"The sea, of course," said Gilbert. "Though
what part of the sea, or what this island is, or where
we are, I haven't the least notion."</p>

<p>"The great question is&mdash;what are we going to
live on?" asked Daniel Meggison, looking round upon
the little company. "Fish we might procure, if anyone
happened to be expert enough to capture them, or
if we had rods and lines; certain berries might also be
discovered which would sustain life. Of course in all
probability so soon as the mist lifts we may be able
to make signals, and to attract the attention of some
passing ship."</p>

<p>"We must find out what lies beyond those rocks,"
said Bessie. "Will you come with me, Mr. Quarle?"</p>

<p>"I'll go with you," broke in Gilbert eagerly; but
she kept her eyes fixed on Simon Quarle, and
presently walked away with him.</p>

<p>"Mr. Quarle&mdash;what is going to happen to us?"
she asked when they were out of ear-shot of the others.
"I am a little afraid, because this has come upon us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
so suddenly; but is there no escape&mdash;no chance of
getting away?"</p>

<p>"Don't know, I'm sure&mdash;utterly impossible to
say," said Quarle. "If we knew where we were,
things might be different; or if the other boats turned
up with the crew in them. But I'm afraid we're a
mere set of amateurs at this Robinson Crusoe business&mdash;and
I don't quite know what really will happen to
us. At any rate we're on dry land&mdash;which is better
than knocking about in an open boat on the sea&mdash;isn't
it?"</p>

<p>They came again to that great wall of rock, and
after some search discovered a sort of natural path
which went up the face of it, and was comparatively
easy to climb. As they gained the top, their worst
suspicions were realized; on the other side of what was
practically merely a thick wall of rocks they heard
the sea booming restlessly and peered only into the
mist which shrouded it. As Quarle had said, this was
the end of the island&mdash;the narrow part of the pear-shaped
place on which the sea had tossed them.</p>

<p>They scrambled down the rocks, and retraced their
steps in a gloomy silence. As they were nearing the
place where they had left the party, Bessie suddenly
stopped, and faced Simon Quarle, and spoke with
something of the old, quiet, steady resolution that had
been hers in Arcadia Street.</p>

<p>"Mr. Quarle&mdash;even if you and I are desperately
afraid we musn't let the others know it," she
said; "we've got to go on keeping brave faces until
something worse happens&mdash;and even then we've got
to keep brave faces. We shall have to make the best
of the provisions we've got; and still we must keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
brave faces even when we're beginning to be hungry.
We've got to find some place to shelter us at night;
and perhaps, after all, help may come sooner than we
anticipate."</p>

<p>"And perhaps, if help doesn't come, or if things
get to the worst, little Miss Make-Believe may contrive
to make us all think that things are better than
they are&mdash;eh?" He smiled at her whimsically.</p>

<p>She stood for a moment looking out to sea; she did
not turn to him when she spoke. "If we can live here
at all, we may need all the make-believe we have in
us," she said. "My poor make-believe seems to have
made shipwreck of my life, and the lives of others too;
perhaps here it may be more useful. I wonder!"</p>

<p>Quarle moved nearer to her for a moment; spoke
to her over her shoulder. "Bessie&mdash;I haven't cared
to say anything to you about&mdash;about yourself&mdash;and
about this man. I rushed off to Newhaven, thinking
you might need a friend; have you nothing to
say to me?"</p>

<p>"Only to thank you," she replied. "There's some
strange Fate working for me&mdash;or against me; I suppose
that's why I've been dropped out of the world I
knew into this place."</p>

<p>"You're not answering my question; you're not
being fair to me," he said. "Have you nothing to say
to me about this matter&mdash;about yourself? Do you
love him?"</p>

<p>She stood still for a moment or two, looking at
the waves tumbling at her feet; the man waited.</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied at last; and then turned swiftly
to him, pouring out a very flood of words upon him.
"I love him with all my heart and soul; there's no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
other man in all the world like him; he's my life&mdash;my
everything. And just for that reason, and just because
of what he has done, I can never have anything
to do with him. In spite of all I said to him, I know
only too well why he lavished all that money on me; I
know that he never meant to wound me, or to shame
me in the eyes of other people. That wasn't his fault;
it was the fault of those who traded upon his generosity.
If I have been shamed and hurt&mdash;how much
more has he been shamed and hurt because of me.
There"&mdash;she laughed quickly, and brushed the tears
from her eyes&mdash;"that's the end of it&mdash;and that's
the last time I shall ever speak of it. It's good to tell
a secret sometimes&mdash;and I've told mine to the best
friend ever a poor unhappy girl had. I won't ask if
you're going to keep my secret&mdash;because that would
be insulting you, and would show that I didn't know
what a good friend I've got. And you won't ever
speak of this again to me?"</p>

<p>He did not answer in words; he took her hand for a
moment, and gripped it; when presently they moved
off towards the others he still held that hand as she
walked beside him. Only when they came in sight of
those who waited for them did he drop the hand, and
resume his ordinary attitude of walking with his own
clasped behind his back.</p>

<p>"It's an island," said Simon Quarle. "We climbed
up the rocks, and there's nothing but the sea beyond.
Therefore we must make the best of it."</p>

<p>"Someone ought to be appointed to look after the
provisions and things generally&mdash;a sort of temporary
ruler," said Daniel Meggison. "As perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
the oldest here I'm quite ready to take the post. It
requires dignity&mdash;and all that sort of thing."</p>

<p>"I think we can leave the question of the provisions
to Pringle," said Gilbert, "with the understanding
that he is to be careful."</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir; most happy, sir," responded
Pringle. "Sparing in all things, sir&mdash;and stimulants
to be kept for medicinal purposes," he added.</p>

<p>"What the devil's the man winking at me for?"
demanded Daniel Meggison fiercely as he turned away.</p>

<p>As the morning advanced the day grew very hot.
There was no protection from the sun whatever on
that side of the island, and it was presently arranged
that one of the spare sails in the boat should be rigged
up to form a species of shelter. There the women sat&mdash;a
little removed from each other, so far as the
Ewart-Cranes and Mrs. Stocker were concerned&mdash;and
dozed at intervals; Bessie seemed to take her
place naturally enough with Simon Quarle and Gilbert
in the actual work that lay before them if they were
to make any attempt to live at all.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, perhaps the most active of them
all was that meek little man, Edward Stocker. Relieved
for the first time in his married life from the
thraldom of Mrs. Stocker, he was like a boy playing
some great game; he entered into it with the zest of a
child. He it was who, setting out to make some
further exploration of the island, and being lost for
an hour or so, was presently observed racing towards
them with wildly waving arms, shouting something
wholly unintelligible as he ran. Mr. Daniel Meggison
seeing him, promptly got behind Simon Quarle, interposing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
that gentleman between himself and coming
danger.</p>

<p>"He is pursued by some terrible beast&mdash;and we
have no weapons!" he shrieked.</p>

<p>However, as Mr. Stocker drew nearer it was
observed that his face was beaming with genuine
pleasure, and that he was evidently very greatly
excited. He bounded into their midst, and announced
his great discovery.</p>

<p>"I say&mdash;gentlemen&mdash;everybody&mdash;I've found a
building!"</p>

<p>"A building?" they echoed, staring at him.</p>

<p>"Up there&mdash;beyond that long hill you can see,"
panted Mr. Stocker, pointing. "It seems like a big
sort of hut&mdash;but I didn't care to go in. Rather
dilapidated&mdash;but unmistakably a hut."</p>

<p>"It is pretty obvious that someone has lived here
before," said Jordan Tant. "More than that, it's
not improbable that someone is living here now.
Somebody had better go and look at the place," he
added. "I'll stay here in case the ladies get alarmed."</p>

<p>Mr. Daniel Meggison also deciding to remain for
the same gallant purpose, the rest of the party
tramped off northwards, guided by Mr. Stocker, who
was obviously not a little proud of himself. Skirting
the foot of the low hills that seemed to lie in the very
centre of the island, they presently came to a large
hut, almost obscured by a tangle of trees and bushes,
but in fairly good condition. After some little hesitation
they ventured to thrust open the crazy door,
and to peer inside; by the light which came streaming
through an aperture near the roof they saw
that the place was empty, and noticed with further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
satisfaction that it was dry and fairly clean. Whatever
hermit had once inhabited it had long since departed,
leaving behind him but few traces of his
occupancy.</p>

<p>A few rough boards had been nailed together in
one corner to form a sort of bed; and on this some
old brushwood still lay. An empty barrel, with nothing
upon it to indicate what it had once contained or
from whence it had come, stood in one corner; and
on a heavy flat stone just under the aperture in the
wall stood an old battered cooking-pot, quite sound,
and with the ashes of some ancient fire still surrounding
it. The place had a ghostly look, even on that
bright sunshiny day; but it was better than nothing.</p>

<p>"With a touch here and there, sir, this place could
be made a palace," said Pringle. "It's a good sizeable
place too; a bit primitive, perhaps, sir, but none
the worse for that. At any rate we could get it ready
for the ladies, sir, against to-night."</p>

<p>"Is it bein' suggested that the gentlemen of the
party sleep in the open air?" asked Aubrey. "I've
nothin' to say against it for myself, mind you&mdash;but
I've not been used to it, and I don't quite see why it
should be necessary, even under special circumstances.
Of course I wouldn't wish&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The ladies will sleep here to-night," said Gilbert.
He turned to Bessie, who had accompanied the party.
"Do you think the ladies will object?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know," she responded, with a half-smile,
"but I should think they'd be glad. Don't you think,
Mr. Byfield, that things are turning out rather
well?"</p>

<p>"Splendidly!" he exclaimed, glad of that friendly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
word from her. "But I wonder who can have lived
in this place&mdash;and lived alone; or so it seems, at
least. Whoever it was must have been taken off, I
suppose, by some passing vessel; but how many years
ago&mdash;or under what circumstances&mdash;it's impossible
to say."</p>

<p>"Whoever it was, we certainly hope and trust he
was a gentleman," said Aubrey, as he moved away.
"My word," he added from a safe distance, "if it
wasn't for my sister I might have somethin' to say
about this that would astonish people!"</p>

<p>That great discovery was duly communicated to
the ladies; Mrs. Stocker, who had had visions of
sleeping in the open air, guarded by Mr. Stocker,
heaved a sigh of relief at the prospect of shelter.
Mrs. Ewart-Crane, on the other hand, took Jordan
Tant aside to speak of a vital matter.</p>

<p>"Island or no island, it is of course distinctly
understood that I do not share the same sleeping accommodation
with the Stocker woman, or with this
girl. Kindly arrange that some other hut is discovered,
or at all events that the present one be divided
into two parts."</p>

<p>"Doesn't it strike you, ma, that we're rather lucky
to get any place to sleep in at all&mdash;and that the
girl, at any rate, isn't half a bad sort?" asked Enid
good-naturedly.</p>

<p>"Silence, Enid; you do not seem to understand
that certain social distinctions must be observed, even
in such a place as this. In London I should not know
the Stocker woman; why should I know her here?
The island is large, I am informed; let her discover
some other place for herself."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>Even in that crisis the wonderful Pringle proved
equal to the emergency. It being mentioned by
Jordan Tant to Gilbert that there was a difficulty
as to the sharing of that limited accommodation designed
for the ladies, Gilbert in despair summoned
his henchman; and Pringle smiled and suggested a
way out.</p>

<p>"It's always the way with the ladies, sir&mdash;bless
'em!" he replied cheerfully. "My poor old mother
never could get on with the next-door neighbour, sir&mdash;no
matter whether we lived in a small and humble
way&mdash;or whether we was in what you might call the
mansions of the great; mother being a caretaker,
sir, and rather a good caretaker at that. Of course
it isn't to be expected that a lady of the stiffness of
Mrs. Crane should wish to lay herself down in the
presence of people she doesn't really know; so I'll
rig a sail up, sir, across the middle, and they can toss
for sides if they can't decide any other way, sir.
Leave it to me, sir; if you'll excuse the liberty, sir,
I may say I know their little failings&mdash;an' I know
just how to humour them, sir."</p>

<p>So the sail was rigged up, and Mrs. Stocker and
Bessie took possession of one side of the hut, while
Mrs. Ewart-Crane and Enid occupied the other.
Pringle had collected brushwood and dried grasses,
and had made two very respectable beds; the moon,
when it came to the hour for retiring, was fine and
fair above them, and the night was warm.</p>

<p>But before that there had come another great surprise,
in the form of an impromptu supper. Certain
provisions had been served out during the day, in a
promiscuous fashion, by Pringle; but now, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
everyone was gathered about the hut, the final preparations
were being made, and "good nights" being
said, Pringle appeared with something of a flickering
smile about his face, and made a startling announcement.</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen&mdash;supper is served!"</p>

<p>"Look here, my man&mdash;a joke is a joke&mdash;but
pray remember your place, and don't carry a joke too
far," said Daniel Meggison sternly. "Remember
who you are&mdash;and take yourself off."</p>

<p>"This way, if you please, sir," said Pringle, taking
not the faintest notice of Daniel Meggison.
"Not far, sir&mdash;just round the corner, as you might
say."</p>

<p>He led the way, and the others followed wonderingly.
Presently they came to a little clearing, sheltered
by the hill that rose behind it; and in that
clearing was a fire upon the ground, and over the fire
was propped the old cooking-pot that had been discovered
in the hut. Bessie was bending over the cooking-pot,
and from it there wafted to the hungry
little company an appetizing odour.</p>

<p>"By Jove!&mdash;this is capital," exclaimed Gilbert.
"We can sit round here in gipsy fashion, and enjoy
it. Pringle&mdash;this is really clever of you."</p>

<p>"I see no necessity for my daughter to be occupied
in a menial office," said Mr. Daniel Meggison stiffly.
"After all, there are certain decencies to be observed,
even in this place."</p>

<p>"Not me, sir&mdash;nothing to do with me, sir," said
Pringle, answering Gilbert Byfield. "I certainly did
gather the sticks for the fire&mdash;but that's about all,
sir. The cooking idea wasn't mine at all; I doubt if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
I could have done it. Miss Meggison, sir, is the lady
who's saved our lives, as you might say, sir, to-night."</p>

<p>"It is certainly well to be experienced in these
matters," said Mrs. Ewart-Crane, lowering herself to
the ground.</p>

<p>"It was quite easy," said Bessie, busying herself
with the pot. "When Pringle and I came to look
into things, we found that there were preserved meats
and preserved vegetables; so it seemed to me that
we might have a sort of stew. It's a little mixed&mdash;but
I think it's nice. Pringle&mdash;the plates, please."</p>

<p>"Certainly, Miss," responded Pringle, and instantly
produced, as if from the result of a conjuring
trick, half a dozen battered old tin plates.</p>

<p>"This is wonderful&mdash;and most comfortable,"
said Mr. Edward Stocker.</p>

<p>"They took a bit of cleanin', sir," explained Pringle.
"I found 'em under some of the rubbish in the
hut&mdash;likewise a knife and fork and a big spoon.
The big spoon's in the pot&mdash;and the knife and fork
I suppose ought to be handed to one of the ladies."</p>

<p>"I have never eaten with my fingers yet&mdash;not even
in the matter of asparagus," said Mrs. Ewart-Crane
instantly.</p>

<p>"Then it's no use your makin' a start at this time
of day&mdash;is it, ma'am?" responded Pringle, handing
over the knife and fork to her with much politeness.
"It's a three-pronger, ma'am&mdash;but still a fork's
a fork."</p>

<p>The steaming food was handed out&mdash;Pringle
deftly holding the battered tin plates to be filled.
The little company was so ravenously hungry that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
even with that limited number of plates there was not
much waiting, nor did it seem to be considered necessary
that the plates should be washed for a newcomer.
Mrs. Ewart-Crane ate with some elegance,
and in a grim silence; the others used their fingers,
and laughed a little among themselves at the strange
meal. Then, when it was all over, and Pringle had
collected the plates, and had taken away the cooking-pot,
the men gathered about the fire&mdash;or what was
left of it&mdash;and sat there on the ground, sharing
what tobacco they had, contentedly enough. Mr.
Tant did not smoke; he sat in a glum silence, staring
into the dying fire.</p>

<p>Gradually the fire burnt itself out; but by that
time the men had made their several arrangements
for sleep. Mr. Tant and Daniel Meggison and Simon
Quarle lay down near the hut in a sheltered place,
and seemed to fall asleep in a few minutes; Gilbert
and Stocker and Aubrey remained by the fire. Presently
they too stretched themselves for slumber; at
the last, Gilbert Byfield, hearing the murmur of the
waves in the distance, thought sleepily how strange
it was that he should have been brought to this place,
and in such company; wondered, without any real
uneasiness, what was to become of them all. A figure
stealing towards him in the darkness roused him; and
he raised himself on one elbow, to find Pringle bending
respectfully over him.</p>

<p>"Anything I can do for you, sir?" asked Pringle,
in a whisper.</p>

<p>"Nothing, thank you. Good night."</p>

<p>"Good night to you, sir," responded Pringle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
"If I might take the liberty of laying myself down,
sir, near to you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"By all means," said Gilbert.</p>

<p>"Much obliged, sir," said Pringle, dropping to
the ground. "I just gave a last look at the hut as
I came past&mdash;and everything seemed very quiet. A
snore or two, sir&mdash;but that only suggests peace.
Good night, sir!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV<br />

<small>THE SIMPLE LIFE</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>IT must not be imagined for a moment that a person
of the quality and the dignity of Mrs. Ewart-Crane
could long sustain life under the conditions
imposed upon her on that first night on the island.
This promiscuous mixing with people in a very different
sphere of life was not at all to her taste; she
set about to remedy matters at the earliest possible
opportunity.</p>

<p>Her slumbers during that night in the hut had been
spoiled, as she declared, by the persistent snoring of
Mrs. Stocker; Mrs. Stocker was equally emphatic
that she had not snored at all, but that Mrs. Ewart-Crane,
on the other hand, had been no quiet neighbour.
To add to the good woman's troubles, her
daughter Enid appeared to have struck up a sort of
friendship with Bessie Meggison; there was much
dodging to and fro from one compartment of the
hut to the other, and a dragging aside in consequence
of the improvised screen. More than that, Mrs.
Ewart-Crane was conscious that after a night during
which she had tossed about restlessly on what she
designated as "leaves and twigs and prickles" she
did not look her best. It seemed, too, that until something
was devised ablutions were impossible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>However, Pringle had been early astir, and there
was something at least in the shape of breakfast,
with a fire to warm the early morning air. They
gathered about it, and made the best of a bad situation,
according to their moods&mdash;Mr. Tant declaring
wheezily that he had caught the worst cold he
had ever had in his life&mdash;and Daniel Meggison stating
that but for an absurd prejudice on the part of
Pringle to allowing him an early morning draught
of strong waters to keep out the cold, this was in
reality the very life for which Daniel Meggison had
been pining throughout his existence.</p>

<p>The finding of a little spring of pure clear water
in the side of the hill above the wood to the west led
to the unfortunate episode of the barrel. There had,
of course, been a barrel containing water, and the
contents had been jealously guarded; but the finding
of the spring supply caused the barrel to be regarded
by Pringle as an ordinary article for domestic use.
Whether or not he felt that Mrs. Stocker looked more
dilapidated than Mrs. Ewart-Crane will never be
known; certain it is that he approached the former
lady smilingly, with the vessel partly filled with water,
and delicately suggested that she might use it for
her ablutions in the privacy of the hut. Mrs. Stocker
was gratefully accepting this boon, forgetful of the
fact that the rigged-up sail, while it concealed her
from the people on the other side of it, did not mask
her voice, when Mrs. Ewart-Crane swept it aside, and
stood indignant before the abashed Pringle and Mrs.
Stocker.</p>

<p>"Is there no one in this community to whom I can
appeal?" demanded Mrs. Ewart-Crane. "Is it not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
sufficient that I am kept awake for the greater part
of one extremely long night, but that now, in the
morning, I am to be ousted from the position Society
has never yet denied to me? Who is this person, that
she should be given precedence over me in such a
matter?"</p>

<p>"I'm very sorry, ma'am," said Pringle, scratching
his chin&mdash;"but I thought perhaps this lady"&mdash;he
indicated Mrs. Stocker, who was standing with
folded arms on guard over the barrel&mdash;"I thought
perhaps&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;what did you think?" demanded Mrs.
Stocker.</p>

<p>Pringle had been on the very point of saying, as
delicately as possible, that he thought she needed it
the most; but cowering under her gaze he abjectly
said&mdash;"Nothing, ma'am"; and pretended to hear
a voice calling him in the distance.</p>

<p>Mrs. Stocker held to her rights, and Mrs. Ewart-Crane
went unwashed. But the matter, of course,
could not end there; and before nightfall it was
known that some other arrangement must be made,
or Mrs. Ewart-Crane at least would take her repose
in the night air. Simon Quarle was disposed to let
her do it; Gilbert looked hopeless; but Jordan Tant
was firm about the matter, and said that another
place must be found. Accordingly a further search
of the island was begun, Pringle throwing himself
into the matter with ardour, and with the utmost
cheerfulness.</p>

<p>It was, after all, but an anticipating of after
events. A little to the south of those miniature hills
which rose in the centre of the island a sort of cave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
was discovered, going back some dozen feet into the
hill itself; and over the front of this the wonderful
Pringle arranged a sort of screen with the other sail,
so that it might be lifted during the day, and form
a pleasant shelter under which to sit, and might be
lowered discreetly at night. To this place Mrs.
Ewart-Crane and Enid were duly escorted; and over
them during the day Mr. Jordan Tant kept watch
and ward&mdash;extending that service even into the
night, when he lay down outside the screen to sleep.</p>

<p>So far as the larger hut was concerned, the screen
which divided it into two was kept in its place; Mrs.
Stocker and Bessie occupied one side, and Daniel
Meggison and Aubrey, with Mr. Edward Stocker, the
other. They would have been willing to make arrangements
for taking in Simon Quarle (though this
was somewhat against the wishes of Daniel Meggison),
but Simon settled the matter in characteristic
fashion by wrapping himself up in a great overcoat
he wore, and sleeping in the boat upon the shore.</p>

<p>Guessing, perhaps, something concerning the difficulty
in which his master found himself with these
uninvited guests, Pringle had even arranged a separate
sleeping place for Gilbert Byfield. On the top
of the hill, just above the spring&mdash;the highest point
in the island&mdash;Pringle laced branches, dragged from
the trees, firmly together between the trunks of some
young saplings growing in a bunch; and after roofing
them over in the same way, contrived a very comfortable
sort of hut for his master. For his own part,
he preferred the freedom of the open air on these
warm nights, despite Gilbert's protests; more than
that, the moon still proving bright, he devoted some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
portion of the night to keeping watch, in the hope
that some passing vessel might cross the wide track
of silver that lay upon the waters.</p>

<p>Thus it came about that only Jordan Tant, in his
devotion, was left outside; and even he succumbed
after a night or two, and crept up the hill, and craved
shelter from Gilbert.</p>

<p>"Personally, I should be glad if I might be permitted
to share this place with you&mdash;at night, I
mean," said Mr. Jordan Tant. "Technically, of
course, we are rivals, and that is a point upon which
I shall never give way. I shudder to think what
might have happened had Enid come to this place
without that constant reminder of my devotion which
my mere presence here affords. Nevertheless, even
those claims must be waived when one is cold, and&mdash;and
lonely."</p>

<p>"Come in, by all means," said Gilbert, smiling.
"If it comes to that, I'm a little lonely myself&mdash;and
a little bit afraid concerning the future. Frankly, I
don't know what is to become of us."</p>

<p>"You alarm me," exclaimed Mr. Tant, seating
himself on the ground, and staring at his friend.</p>

<p>"You see, we might stay here for months&mdash;and
I haven't the ghost of a notion what we're to get to
eat," went on Gilbert. "I don't care to alarm the
ladies about the matter, and I've said nothing to anyone
yet, except Pringle. But he tells me that the
tinned foods are almost gone, and even his ingenuity
hasn't been sufficient to enable him to catch any fish.
In other words, my dear Tant, we're on the verge of
starvation."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>"We may see a vessel," said Mr. Tant, with a
gloomy face.</p>

<p>"And that vessel may not see us," retorted Gilbert.
"In any case, we don't seem to have been noticed
yet, and the position is a desperate one. If
nothing happens within the next twenty-four hours
we must have a volunteer party for the boat, and that
party must start off in the hope of discovering some
other land comparatively near."</p>

<p>"I suppose you've no idea where we are?" asked
Tant.</p>

<p>Gilbert Byfield shook his head. "Not the least in
the world," he said. "I paid no heed to the direction
in which the vessel was going during those few days
of our voyage, nor do I even know at what rate we
went, nor how far. There's one curious thing about
this island, by the way."</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked the other.</p>

<p>"Why, that the vegetation is not tropical, nor, for
the matter of that, is the climate. I am more puzzled
than I can say; but all the puzzling in the world
won't help us. Food we must have, and clothing;
the ladies especially are at a serious inconvenience,
in having nothing but what they stand up in."</p>

<p>"Personally, of course, I should like to do something
of an apparently brave nature&mdash;something in
the way of a rescue&mdash;just to impress Enid," said
Mr. Tant thoughtfully. "But I expect that when
it comes to the pinch that sort of thing will fall to
your share, and I shall have to stand aside and look
on. And she admires brave men; she's rather rubbed
that point in once or twice."</p>

<p>"I'll promise you that if anything does happen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
that calls for bravery, you shall have the first chance,
Tant," said Gilbert.</p>

<p>"I wasn't exactly suggesting that; there's nothing
selfish about me, I hope," retorted Tant.</p>

<p>Presently he leaned back against the trunk of a
tree, and fell into an uneasy slumber. Anxiety kept
Byfield awake, and presently also urged him to leave
the rough little hut, and to set off on a ramble in the
moonlight. Pringle, sleeping like a dog with one eye
open, stirred and sat up; then, reassured, lay down
to sleep again. Gilbert picked his way down the
hillside into the wood, hearing more and more distinctly
as he moved the murmur of the sea. And most
of all now, in the silence of the night, he thought of
Bessie&mdash;Bessie who had never complained; Bessie
who worked hard, even here, for others; Bessie who
had been, in her love and her innocence, so shamefully
treated. He knew that he had brought ruin upon
her, in the sense that she would never accept from him
any help in the future, even should it happen that
they were rescued from that place. He knew that she
must start in some other Arcadia Street that old
sordid battle of life he had but interrupted. He remembered
bitterly enough how she had avoided him
almost completely in this place; he knew that she felt
that everyone about her knew now in what way she
had lived, and on whose charity; he understood that
she raged fiercely within herself at the thought of
uncharitable eyes that watched her, and uncharitable
lips that whispered about her.</p>

<p>He went down through the wood, and came out
upon the shore at the western side of the island. And
there, standing startlingly enough in that deserted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
place, was a woman at the very margin of the sea,
her figure showing dark against the moonlit water
and the sky. He went forward wonderingly, and yet
with a vague feeling in his mind that he knew who
it was; and so came to her, and spoke her name.</p>

<p>"Bessie!"</p>

<p>"I couldn't sleep; I came out into the silence and
the moonlight; I wanted to think," she said; and in
that solemn hour it seemed as though the barrier she
had raised between them had gone down again, and
could not ever again separate them. She seemed to
look at him with the old friendliness; she let her
hands rest in his, while they stood together, with only
the sea and the moon for company.</p>

<p>"I couldn't sleep&mdash;and I too wanted to think,"
he said. "I wanted to think most about you&mdash;about
all that I had wanted and longed to do for you&mdash;and
about all the ruin I have brought upon you. I
have remembered all that you said to me on board
the yacht&mdash;all that I deserved you should say to
me."</p>

<p>"I don't want you to remember that," she told
him earnestly. "I lay awake there to-night, and remembered
that you were the only one that had ever
gone out of your way to do anything for me, or to
help me; I remembered that you spent your money
recklessly for me, and to give me pleasure. And
after that I said vile things to you, and told you that
I hated you."</p>

<p>"I deserved it every bit," said Gilbert. "I didn't
understand at the time&mdash;but I treated you like a
child, without care or thought of your feelings in the
matter&mdash;or of your future. I lied to you, and deceived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
you; but there was one matter about which I
didn't lie."</p>

<p>"What was that?" she asked.</p>

<p>"When I said I loved you. That was true enough&mdash;it
grows more true every day I live. I wouldn't
part with any hour of all that we have spent together;
I wouldn't go back, or undo anything I have
done, if the undoing meant that I must lose any hour
of that time. The yacht is gone&mdash;and we are poor
castaways who may never leave this place alive; yet
I'm glad&mdash;selfishly and brutally glad&mdash;for my own
sake. Do you understand me, Bessie?"</p>

<p>She nodded slowly, keeping her head turned away
from him. "Yes&mdash;I understand," she replied.
"And I believe you. I never meant anything that
I said to you on the yacht&mdash;about the hating part,
I mean," she added in a whisper.</p>

<p>He put his arms about her, and drew her close to
him. "Have you nothing further to say to me?&mdash;or
do you shut me out of your life altogether, Bessie?"
he asked.</p>

<p>She bent her head down until her face was hidden
on his arm. "You know I can't do that, dear," she
whispered. "I've tried hard to do it&mdash;but love
won't let me."</p>

<p>They stood for a long time there, without word
or movement; it seemed as though, while he held her
in his arms and she lay contentedly on his breast, no
words were needed. And all else was forgotten&mdash;past
bitternesses and misunderstandings&mdash;and even
their present situation. That they were poor prisoners,
cast away hopelessly and helplessly on an
island of which they did not even know the name, did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
not matter then; for love has wide wings that may
stretch even across great continents and great seas.
Arcadia Street and Fiddler's Green and all the rest
of the amazing business lay far behind; they stood
here in the moonlight and silence, forgetting even
the grotesque figures that slept so near them.</p>

<div class="caption">"THEY STOOD HERE IN THE MOONLIGHT AND SILENCE." <i>Page 253</i></div>
</div>

<p>"It is strange to think, sweetheart, how all the life
we knew&mdash;the only life we seemed to understand&mdash;is
left behind and forgotten," he whispered presently.
"We were this and that in the world&mdash;and it was
as if the great place could not go on without us;
and in a moment we're swept away, and lost, and left
stranded, high and dry out of all the hurly-burly of
it. What is going to become of us I don't know&mdash;but
even that doesn't matter."</p>

<p>"Nothing matters at all; nothing will ever matter
again," she whispered. "But oh, my dear love&mdash;I
do pray you never to let me make-believe any more&mdash;always
to let me understand exactly what is happening&mdash;exactly
the truth. The poor game has
been played out now to the bitter end; promise me
that whatever the future may hold for us, my dear,
we shall face it hand in hand, and without any pretence
about it. Promise me that solemnly."</p>

<p>He kissed her lips, and promised solemnly that in
future she should always know the truth.</p>

<p>They left the sea behind them, and went up together
through the woods towards the hut that had
been made for him by the industrious Pringle; it
was a shorter way to her own sleeping place in the
bigger hut. Quite near to the place where the unconscious
Jordan Tant crouched inside his shelter and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
slumbered fitfully the pair halted for a moment, as
a sudden thought occurred to Gilbert.</p>

<p>"My darling Bessie&mdash;I want you to understand
that I wouldn't have anything that has happened
changed in the least," he said, in a low tone. "I
could never have had you all to myself in any other
place; foolish scruples and conventions would have
crept in, and you would have run away from me, and
I should have lost you in the big world. If someone
came to me to-morrow, and told me that we could be
rescued, and could go back to the commonplace world
again, honestly I think that I would not be glad.
If only we can manage to live somehow I want to stop
here with you always."</p>

<p>They went on down across the hill, and disappeared
from sight. Within a few yards of where they had
stopped Pringle raised himself on his elbow, wide
awake, and stared after them.</p>

<p>"That settles it!" he said to himself. "I was
in two minds about it, after what I found out this
mornin'; but if the guv'nor wants an island, an
island he shall have. I was never in love myself&mdash;not
to any great extent; but it's pretty to see it in
others. Pringle, my boy, you are on an island, whatever
Nature may say to the contrary; consequently,
keep your mouth shut, and go to sleep."</p>

<p>He dropped down again contentedly&mdash;chuckled
once softly to himself&mdash;and slept.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br />

<small>THE AMAZING PRINGLE</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>JUST so surely as had come about the division of
the little company into its several parts, socially
speaking&mdash;that necessary "drawing of the line"
insisted upon in all things by Mr. Jordan Tant&mdash;so
did it come about that the party he represented
withdrew itself more and more from the rest of the
islanders. It might have been thought that their
common difficulties would have drawn them together;
but the fact remains that the shabbier Mrs. Ewart-Crane
and her daughter became the more urgent was
it that their real position in the greater world should
be firmly impressed upon those with whom they had
been thrown in contact.</p>

<p>Much tramping about over sand and rocks, and the
necessity for sleeping on a bed of dry leaves and
brushwood, to say nothing of a night journey in an
open boat, had brought Mrs. Ewart-Crane's one dress
to a condition of which a London charwoman would
have been ashamed; while Enid was in no better
plight. But although Mrs. Ewart-Crane was well
aware that Mrs. Stocker was in the same lamentable
condition, she resolutely declined to make common
ground of complaint with her on that score; in other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
words, Mrs. Ewart-Crane wore her shabbiness with
an air.</p>

<p>The same condition of things ruled with the men.
Mr. Jordan Tant had hitherto been a slave to nice
detail concerning collars and ties, and neat shoes and
socks; but those details, in his present case, were
things to blush at. The neat suit he usually wore in
the mornings, and in which he had taken that mad
journey to the yacht, was creased and soiled and
stained; his hat had been flung to the laughing
waves by a wind more boisterous than discreet; and
he had been compelled perforce to grow a beard,
which he felt did not suit his type of face. True,
there were improvements in the man, in the sense of
an added colour in his cheeks, and more alert movements
in his limbs; but such things he scorned.</p>

<p>Mr. Daniel Meggison, in a moment of forgetfulness,
had gone to his improvised couch with his silk
hat on his head, and thereafter had grown careless
in regard to its appearance; it had become a mere
dilapidated head covering, with no dignity about it at
all. Contact with thorns and brambles had made
shipwreck of the immaculate frock-coat; his linen
was non-apparent. In fact, to put the matter
shortly, the little company had suffered from the fact
that they had at the beginning but one suit of clothing
apiece, and no means of replenishing it.</p>

<p>The difficulty about food had been overcome by a
sheer gift from Providence. There had come a night
when they had sat about their fire, and when with discretion,
and yet firmness, Gilbert Byfield had told
them of the condition of the larder. The matter had
to be broached somehow, because Aubrey Meggison<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
had picked up his small portion of food from his tin
plate disdainfully, and had muttered something about
"stinginess."</p>

<p>"I think the time has come," said Gilbert solemnly,
"when we should understand clearly&mdash;all of
us&mdash;the exact position. We have been remarkably
careful with the few things we were able to bring
away&mdash;but we have found nothing on the island&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Beggin' your pardon, sir&mdash;except water," said
Pringle, with deference.</p>

<p>"I had forgotten the water," replied Gilbert, with
a smile. "Our case would indeed have been hopeless
had we not been fortunate enough to find the spring.
But our tinned provisions have gone, and we have
no means of replacing them; and even with the utmost
care we have had to go on short rations for the
last day or two. To-morrow's breakfast is provided;
after that we face starvation."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to suggest, my dear Gilbert, that
we are to look at each other with the certain knowledge
that we are to shrink day by day, with no hope
of relief?" demanded Mrs. Ewart-Crane.</p>

<p>"In the name of the ladies under my charge, I
protest," said Mr. Jordan Tant. "It was not by
our wish that we were brought to this place at all;
it will certainly not be by our wish that we starve
here. I enter a solemn protest against it."</p>

<p>"I have been shuttle-cocked about from one place
to another&mdash;despite my protests," said Daniel Meggison.
"I make the common demand that each man
has a right to make; I insist upon being fed. Look
to it, someone, that the matter receives attention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
before to-morrow. My position in the world has
hitherto been framed upon that common and ordinary
basis; being in the world, I demand to be fed."</p>

<p>"Seems to me that the real point is&mdash;what is
generally done in these cases?" demanded Aubrey.
"There must be a rule about these matters&mdash;a law,
or something of that sort. I've read the newspapers
pretty consistently since I've moved about the world;
what's the exact procedure? I should like to say that
my father&mdash;(with whom, mind you, I'm not going
to say that I generally agree)&mdash;my father has
voiced my opinion to what I might call a T. To put
it simply: what happens?"</p>

<p>"I should imagine, for my own part, that one member
of our pleasant little party will be missing after
to-morrow&mdash;and the rest will feed sumptuously,"
said Simon Quarle, with a perfectly serious face.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ewart-Crane rose, and stretched out a hand
for her daughter. "Enid," she said, in accents of
considerable dignity&mdash;"I desire that we withdraw.
There are certain questions which cannot be discussed
in this public manner, if one has any desire to retain
one's natural feelings of delicacy. And I should like
to add," she went on, waving Mr. Tant to his feet
with an imperious movement of her hand&mdash;"I should
really like to add that in the event of any casting
of lots, or any other such barbarous procedure, Mr.
Tant will be our protector, and will not hesitate to
sell his life dearly. Mr. Tant&mdash;Enid&mdash;let us go,
before I feel called upon to express myself more
strongly."</p>

<p>Simon Quarle and Gilbert walked long upon the
shore that night, talking earnestly. Gilbert was disposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
to be hopeful; a ship might heave in sight at
any moment&mdash;or all sorts of things might happen
that then seemed improbable. Simon Quarle pointed
out that no ship had yet been seen, and that nothing
else was likely to happen; incidentally he mentioned
the one course open to them.</p>

<p>"We must launch the boat to-morrow, and start
off in the hope of finding some other land near at
hand," he said. "If those who go in the boat don't
come back, then the others must starve, or find a way
out for themselves; in any case there's nothing else
to be done. Let's get to sleep, and forget our troubles
for one night at least."</p>

<p>After all, it was Pringle who was the direct agent
of Providence. I would not have you think that in
that respect Providence passed over better men; in
all probability it was because Pringle had a habit of
getting up early in the morning, and lighting that
open-air fire, and generally preparing what food
there was for the early meal. And in that way it came
about that Pringle brought deliverance to the islanders
in a quite miraculous fashion.</p>

<p>Gilbert Byfield had not slept during that anxious
night; in a sense he felt that, by reason of the mad
impulse that had started him on that wild journey
from Newhaven, he was responsible for the lives of
those concerned with him in the venture. Dawn was
breaking, with the promise of a perfect day to follow,
when he stepped over the legs of the sleeping Jordan
Tant, and went down the hill to find Simon Quarle.</p>

<p>Simon was sleeping peacefully in his self-appointed
quarters in the boat; he roused himself sleepily when
Gilbert laid a hand on his shoulder. "Oh&mdash;you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
needn't remind me," he said, with a grim nod; "I've
been dreaming that I was a starving loafer in the
streets of London, and that all the workhouses and
casual wards were shut. I believe we have breakfast&mdash;don't
we?"</p>

<p>"And a meagre one at that," replied Gilbert, sitting
on the edge of the boat. "And after that a
council of war, and a decision as to what is to be
done."</p>

<p>"You're not the only one that's awake early, my
friend," said Simon Quarle, pointing in the direction
of the north of the island. "Who's that coming in
the distance?"</p>

<p>"It looks like Pringle," said Gilbert&mdash;"and he's
carrying something."</p>

<p>They waited while the unconscious Pringle drew
nearer. As a matter of fact he was staggering under
a load poised upon his shoulders; as he came within
hail of them it seemed that the load was a heavy
square packing-case. Evidently he had not expected
anyone to be awake at that hour; as he trudged
through the sand he was humming a jaunty tune
jerkily to himself as though to encourage himself in
his efforts. Being hailed suddenly by the deep voice
of Simon Quarle, he stopped, and stared, and then
let the packing-case down plump into the sand. And
it must be confessed that at that moment he wore a
curiously guilty air.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;what have you got there, Pringle?" demanded
Gilbert, advancing towards him. "Where
did you get that from?"</p>

<p>"This, sir," asked the innocent Pringle. "Oh&mdash;this,
sir? Washed ashore, sir."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>"Washed ashore!" exclaimed Simon Quarle, looking
at the case curiously. "Do you know what's
in it?"</p>

<p>"Not the least notion in the world, sir," said
Pringle, sitting upon the case, and looking down at
it between his legs. "Out for an early morning
stroll, sir, there it was, knockin' about just on the
shore; in fact while I was lookin' at it&mdash;stupid like,
you'll understand, sir&mdash;the sea give it a shove, and
pushed it up at my very feet. I shouldn't be surprised,
sir, if it didn't hold food."</p>

<p>"Do you think it's come from the yacht?" asked
Gilbert.</p>

<p>"I should think so, sir," said Pringle. "Now I
come to think of it, sir, there was one or two cases
on board the very identical of this. Food, sir, I
should think&mdash;and perhaps other things. Washed
ashore, sir&mdash;that's what this was."</p>

<p>"It doesn't seem to have been knocked about
much," said Gilbert, walking round it curiously.
"It's a frail sort of case to have been tossing about
in the sea for so long a time. I hope the contents
are not damaged."</p>

<p>"We'll hope not, sir," replied Pringle cheerfully,
as he stooped to pick up the case. "Bit of luck
I call this, sir," he added, as with the assistance of
Simon Quarle he got it onto his shoulders. "Not that
I'll promise anything about the contents, sir; it
might be almost anything."</p>

<p>"Where exactly did it come ashore?" demanded
Quarle.</p>

<p>"Just by the rocks, sir," said Pringle. "It was
lucky, in a way, that I happened to be there, sir;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
what you might call a yard or two further on it
would have missed the island altogether, and missed
us. Great bit of luck, sir."</p>

<p>The case, on being wrenched open, was found to
contain a considerable quantity of tinned food, together
with some that was not tinned, and that was
remarkably fresh. There were tins of biscuits;
there was tea and sugar and other things, as wonderful
in that place as they were unexpected.
Pringle, for his part, was very modest about it all;
he described again and again to the wondering people
who presently seated themselves about the fire
exactly how the considerate sea had tossed the case
at his very feet, and how he had picked it up.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ewart-Crane, relieved from the fear that
her life might be in danger, made some advances
to Mrs. Stocker, and even consented to listen with
gravity to an account by that lady of the difficulties
of rearing chickens in the neighbourhood of
Clapham; "there was something in the air," according
to Mrs. Stocker.</p>

<p>In a sense it may be said that among some of them
at least a better feeling of comradeship sprang up.
The fear of actual starvation was gone; the weather
was superb, and they were all in excellent bodily
health. It grew to be a sort of great picnic on the
island, and those who had been at first inclined to
grumble were now in a minority, and began to feel
that for their own sakes they had best take what the
gods sent them with an approach to smiling faces.
Perhaps for the change Bessie Meggison was in a
sense directly responsible; because that new happiness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
that had come to her had painted even this
small and uncomfortable world in rosy colours.</p>

<p>There grew to be a sort of competition among
them as to who should discover the next bit of wreckage
to be cast ashore. Mr. Meggison visited the
neighbourhood of the rocks more than once, and
peered frowningly out to sea; but he never discovered
anything. Aubrey Meggison listlessly wandered
round the shore&mdash;perhaps in the hope of
finding something of actual use to himself; but he
was as unsuccessful as his father. It came at last
to this: that the only one of them all to do any real
salvage work was Pringle. At intervals Pringle
was able to bring to them the most astonishing
things that had been washed ashore conveniently for
his picking up.</p>

<p>Strangely, too, the things he found were always
useful. It was no mere matter of broken woodwork,
such as might be expected to come from the wrecked
yacht; again and again he discovered in the most
miraculous way articles for which a wish had actually
been expressed by some member of the community.
Food tumbled upon the shore almost in
abundance; and always food that was wanted. The
various articles that had been in use on the yacht
must have been curiously packed; for tinned foods
actually arrived more than once accompanied by
articles of clothing that were distinctly useful to the
shipwrecked party.</p>

<p>Thus it happened one day that some coarse strong
flannel shirts were flung at the feet of Pringle in
the early morning, and were distributed to the male
members of the party soon afterwards. Gilbert examined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
one of them with a thoughtful frown, and
then took Pringle aside.</p>

<p>"I can't understand this, Pringle," he said, looking
at the garment.</p>

<p>"No, sir?"</p>

<p>"No. I don't see how these things could have been
on board the yacht; who could possibly have bought
them."</p>

<p>"You're forgettin' the crew, sir. Sailors ain't as
delicate in their feelings as gentlemen, sir; take my
word for it, I shouldn't be a bit surprised if they
hadn't belonged somehow to the crew."</p>

<p>So the shirts were accepted, and worn with gratitude;
even Pringle admitted how astonishing it was
that they should have been flung on to the island just
when they were most wanted. Emboldened by his
success, he smilingly predicted that he shouldn't be a
bit surprised if something else equally useful turned
up within a day or two; and sure enough a considerable
quantity of cheap strong print, with a pleasing
design of pink rosebuds upon it, arrived one morning,
and was brought in triumph to the ladies. On this
occasion it seemed that the box in which the material
had been contained had burst upon the shore, and the
wood had been carried out to sea. The print was
a little damp in one place; but Pringle seemed to have
been amazingly clever in snatching it out of the reach
of the waves.</p>

<p>The making of dresses for the ladies was left to a
large extent to Bessie, with the assistance of Mrs.
Stocker. Bessie&mdash;careful little soul!&mdash;had needles
and cottons and a tiny pair of scissors and other
necessary things in a little case in her pocket; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
although Mrs. Ewart-Crane at first expressed herself
strongly as to why print of a superior pattern
had not been found for her daughter and herself, she
ultimately accepted, even with some show of gratitude,
the uniform provided for her. It was a curious
sight at first to see them all arrayed alike; but that
created some laughter, and was not in the end really
resented.</p>

<p>The packages arrived in no particular order; it
was always possible that when they sat down to their
open-air breakfast Pringle would have a surprise for
them&mdash;or, on the other hand, it was possible that he
would respectfully shake his head, as a sign that the
sea had not been kindly disposed. Now and then some
of the things flung up seemed to require some explanation;
but Pringle always evaded any direct
reference to them, and murmured something about being
grateful to Providence. It was only when the
new timber arrived, and was smilingly announced by
Pringle as he handed round the tea, that Gilbert Byfield
and Simon Quarle stared at the man, open-mouthed
and wondering.</p>

<p>"I can't quite understand it myself, sir," said
Pringle, keeping his eyes fixed upon the cup he was
holding. "Nice clean boards, sir&mdash;and all about the
same length. Rather handy, I should think, sir, for
building an extra shelter for the ladies."</p>

<p>In a solemn silence Gilbert and Quarle walked down
to the shore, with Pringle a step or two behind. There
lay a pile of boards stacked neatly out of the reach of
the sea; Pringle scratched his chin thoughtfully as he
looked at them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>"These haven't come from the yacht," said Gilbert.
"There was no loose timber there."</p>

<p>"No, sir,&mdash;of course not, sir," said Pringle.
"Some unfortunate timber ship, I should think, sir.
P'r'aps I ought to say, sir, that it didn't come all at
once&mdash;just a board or two at a time. I didn't think
anything of the first one; I only mentioned it this
morning because I thought it might come in useful,
sir. Such a lot of things have washed on shore that
I haven't noticed very much about them."</p>

<p>"It seems rather a pity that we haven't a hammer
and nails," said Simon Quarle, after a pause.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;didn't I tell you, sir?" Pringle looked
round innocently at his master. "There was a few
tools came in the last package, sir&mdash;and some nails
and things. I dare say some building work might be
managed, sir."</p>

<p>"You certainly didn't mention it," said Gilbert,
staring at him.</p>

<p>"Very careless of me, sir," said Pringle.</p>

<p>So a fresh hut was built, with trees for its main
support; and into this Mrs. Ewart-Crane and her
daughter were induced to go. Mrs. Ewart-Crane, indeed,
seemed quite pleased with her new abode, and
was almost on the point of giving herself airs again
in regard to it. Simon Quarle also was induced at
last to leave the boat, and to take up his quarters in
the cave-like place vacated by the ladies; this he
shared with Mr. Jordan Tant. The supplies that had
so miraculously come to them had given them confidence,
and they had practically ceased to think of the
future, or of what it might hold for them, beyond that
place to which they had been so strangely brought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>Nor did those supplies cease; from time to time
other packages arrived&mdash;always to be discovered by
the industrious Pringle; so that in time the wonder
of the thing ceased, and it never occurred to any one
of them to ask from whence the things came, or how
long the yacht was to take in breaking up and in
delivering itself of the many useful things it evidently
contained. The weeks went by, and it was altogether
a very happy and contented little band of people,
albeit queerly dressed.</p>

<p>The inevitable discovery was made one morning
quite early by Gilbert. The beauty of the morning
had tempted him, and he had come out to taste the
pure air, and to feel the warmth of the coming day.
He found that Pringle, as usual, had been early astir;
but he took no notice of that. Pringle was ever an
early riser, and there was much to be done each day
before the little company gathered round the fire for
breakfast.</p>

<p>Gilbert strode away down the hill until he came to
the eastern shore of the island; waited there a
moment, as though undecided in which direction to
turn. Then suddenly he became aware of a figure
marching steadily towards the rocks at the north of
the island; and, gazing more intently, discovered that
figure to be Pringle, moving steadily and as though
with a set purpose.</p>

<p>"What's the fellow up to now?" Gilbert asked
himself, inwardly amused.</p>

<p>He decided to follow; and, keeping a safe distance
between his servant and himself, presently saw that
servant come to the great line of rocks which bounded
the island to the north. But strangely enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
Pringle did not stop there; in the mist of the morning
he stepped as it seemed straight out into the sea, and
disappeared.</p>

<p>Greatly amazed, Gilbert broke into a run, and did
not stop until he had come to the very edge of the
rocks where, as he had seen them before, they jutted
into the sea. But now there was a clean, clear stretch
of sand round the base of them, and it was along this
stretch of sand that Pringle had gone. Without a
moment's hesitation Gilbert Byfield ran round the
high wall of rock&mdash;and so stepped at once into the
heart of the mystery.</p>

<p>Pringle was hurrying ahead of him&mdash;not into a
watery grave, but straight along a little spit of land
that had been left dry by the receding tide. As in a
dream, Byfield followed; and presently found himself
climbing a path on to another land, and seeing before
him as he went evidences of civilization, in the shape
of cultivated fields, and decent stone walls and gates.
And still Pringle went ahead, looking neither to right
nor left nor backwards.</p>

<p>It was only when Gilbert had topped the rise, and
had come to a little old-fashioned bridge, that he
stopped and let Pringle go ahead, and looked about
him. Below lay a prosperous-looking little village,
with already early morning smoke rising from many
chimneys; about him in all directions were cultivated
fields. He seated himself on the parapet of the
bridge, and watched the hurrying figure of Pringle
dipping down into civilization; and then all in a
moment he understood for the first time the fraud that
had been practised upon him. To his credit be it said
he sat upon the bridge, looking after Pringle (now a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
mere dot upon the landscape), and shouted with
laughter.</p>

<p>He sat there for a long time, until presently the
black dot appeared again out of the intricacies of the
village, and began to climb the hill. When presently
Pringle reappeared, he bore upon his shoulders yet
another of those mysterious packages with which he
had so thoughtfully provided the islanders. Toiling
up the hill, singing cheerfully to himself, he stopped
only when the long shadow of Gilbert fell across his
path; paused for a moment to look at this surprising
stranger watching him; and dropped his burden in
the dust of the road.</p>

<p>"Morning, sir," said Pringle, a little nervously.
And then, looking at the packing-case that lay between
them, he added more nervously still, and yet
with a dawning smile about his lips&mdash;"Washed
ashore, sir!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII<br />

<small>EXPLANATIONS</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>DURING the time he had awaited the return of
Pringle, Gilbert Byfield had been able to look
the position clearly in the face, and to understand
exactly how he was situated. Bessie alone had to be
considered; her opinion of the situation was the one
thing to be thought of then. After that first burst of
laughter the real tragedy faced him, and was not to
be lightly thrust aside.</p>

<p>For when this was discovered, as it must be&mdash;when
this amazing fraud was laid bare&mdash;she would see
once again that the man who professed to love her
had treated her as a child, and had played again that
amazing game of make-believe. So much she must
believe; for it would never be credited that Pringle
had acted on his own responsibility, and that his
master had been innocent. Once again the girl must
be held up to ridicule; once again it must be shown
that she had been playing with life, just as she had
played with it, outside the sordid details of ordinary
existence, in the old garden in Arcadia Street. The
island was no island at all; but for some extraordinary
circumstance, yet to be discovered, the little
party must have been rescued a dozen times over. The
comforts of civilization had lain within a mile of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>;
yet they had dealt out food sparingly, and had been
tricked by a servant into believing that a special
Providence had watched over them, and had provided
them miraculously with things the man had actually
purchased.</p>

<p>"How long has this game been going on,
Pringle?" asked Gilbert at last, looking down at
the man, who had seated himself upon the packing-case
in the road.</p>

<p>"Quite a long time, sir," said Pringle, recovering
his cheerfulness a little. "I've done my best, sir."</p>

<p>"Your best?" exclaimed Gilbert. "Don't you understand
the position in which you have placed me;
don't you understand that they've all been cheated
and fooled&mdash;and that they'll believe it's my fault.
What induced you to play such a game?"</p>

<p>Pringle looked really aggrieved. "It was my wish,
sir, to please you," he said. "In a wakeful moment,
sir, I happened to overhear you say something to the
young lady about liking the idea of this being an
island&mdash;I mean that place over there, sir&mdash;and
you being cut off romantic-like with her, with nobody
to interfere, sir. I'd only found out a little while
before that at a certain state of the tide you could
cut across to the mainland; and as everybody was
so comfortable and happy, it seemed to me that it
wasn't at all a bad idea to keep the game alive, sir,
when that game was so easy played. I had money
with me, sir, part of which I'd used for stocking the
yacht and paying wages, so there wasn't no difficulty."</p>

<p>"Have you any idea where we are, or what that
village is?" asked Gilbert, after a gloomy pause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>"I haven't made any exact inquiries, sir&mdash;but
from the tongue and from general appearances I believe
we're on a remote part of the western coast of
Ireland. Nice people, sir&mdash;but a bit superstitious."</p>

<p>"Superstitious? What do you mean?" asked Byfield.</p>

<p>"Well, sir&mdash;luckily for us, they're a little bit
afraid of that bit of land we've called an island;
there's a sort of feeling among them that it's haunted,
sir."</p>

<p>"Haunted?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. It seems that there was a man who had
a big house here who went a bit off his head, sir; and
one day, when the tide was low, he slipped across to
that bit of land, and had a look at it. He liked it,
sir&mdash;and he liked the loneliness; so he got them to
bring timber and so on out to him, and build him that
shed that we first found on the day of our arrival.
After that, sir," went on Pringle, "he liked it so much
that he lived there altogether; cooked his own food,
sir, and made a sort of hermit of himself. And then
one day took it into his head to die, sir."</p>

<p>"Not a word of this to the ladies, mind," said
Gilbert hastily.</p>

<p>"Not for the world, sir," responded Pringle
solemnly. "It seems, sir, that somebody came out to
him, to bring food or something or other, and found
that he'd passed away, sir; and ever since then there's
been a feeling that his ghost is knocking about, sir&mdash;unquiet
like. Consequently no one comes to the
place&mdash;which is a bit fortunate for us, sir."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you think it's fortunate, Pringle," retorted
Gilbert. "And pray what explanation have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
you given of your purchases, and your surreptitious
visits to the village?"</p>

<p>Pringle got up from the box, and passed a hand
slowly across his mouth; it was as though with that
action he wiped away a smile that would not have
been becoming to the situation. "Well, sir, you see,
I found it a bit difficult at first, sir; the natives were
what you might call a bit avaricious, and had a fancy
for running over to the island, and selling things that
they didn't actually want to keep themselves. So
havin' discovered, sir, about the last tenant, I was
careful to spread it about that you was another one
of the same kidney, sir; and I never said a word about
anybody else bein' there at all. I hope you'll excuse
the liberty, sir&mdash;but something had to be done under
the circumstances. As a matter of fact, sir, of course
they were only too willin' to be quiet, because I've been
rather a good customer to the village, one way and
another, sir."</p>

<p>The sheer absurdity of the thing was borne in
again upon Gilbert Byfield. From where he sat he
could see the path leading down the narrow strip of
sand; beyond that the great wall of rock&mdash;and beyond
that (in his imagination, at least) the little company
who had been playing, all unconsciously, that
game of privation and starvation for weeks past. He
thought of how the business had begun&mdash;far away
in Arcadia Street; of that mad race to the yacht; of
this madder business on an island that had never been
an island at all. He thought of the outrageous
costumes carefully made from comic-opera material
supplied by the resourceful Pringle: and he told himself
bitterly enough that the one being for whom it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
had all been done, and for whom the sorry business
had been kept up, would believe less than ever that the
man had not planned it all himself in sheer mockery
of her.</p>

<p>The voice of Pringle recalled him to a remembrance
of where he was. "Excuse me, sir&mdash;but we shan't
get back if we don't look quick, sir. The tide's coming
up fast."</p>

<p>Gilbert set off at once, and Pringle, shouldering the
box, followed him. As they came to the narrow strip
of land, Gilbert turned to the man, and voiced for a
moment what was in his mind.</p>

<p>"For the present you will say nothing, Pringle,"
he suggested.</p>

<p>"Very good, sir," replied the man.</p>

<p>"When the time comes for the truth to be told, I'll
tell it," went on Gilbert. "You've landed me into
rather a difficulty, Pringle; such a lot of explanations
will be necessary&mdash;explanations that will not be believed.
For the next few days, at all events, our
necessaries will come to us in the same romantic
fashion as before&mdash;and not from the village shops."</p>

<p>"I quite understand, sir," said Pringle. "And if
you don't hurry up, sir, we shall have to wade."</p>

<p>They just got round the corner of the line of rocks
in time; the sea was within a foot or two of their base,
and was rapidly rising. In due course Pringle appeared
with the news that was no longer surprising;
that another box had been washed ashore. There
being in it nothing more exciting than provisions, the
discovery passed almost without comment.</p>

<p>Now the sea fell only in the very early morning,
leaving that neck of land exposed; and fortunately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
for Gilbert's scheme the islanders were not early risers.
Pringle, who had kept the secret so well, would keep
it even better for the future; Gilbert had nothing to
fear from him. Nothing short of an accident could
betray the fact that they were so near to civilization,
and an accident of that sort was not likely to happen.
The splendid summer weather and the open-air life
and the freedom from anxiety and world-worry had
had a soothing effect upon them all; they accepted
all that came to them with the blind confidence of
children, and appeared almost to have forgotten that
they had ever led any other lives.</p>

<p>But the accident came, and the secret was surprised
by the most unexpected person of them all.
Gilbert had retired to his hut one night, when he
thought he heard a movement outside it; and, knowing
that Pringle was still busily occupied with domestic
arrangements over the remains of the fire, he went
out to see who was stirring at that hour. Somewhat
to his surprise he saw Mr. Edward Stocker in the
moonlight, smiling apologetically, and bowing with
ceremony.</p>

<p>"Is anything the matter?" asked Gilbert.</p>

<p>"Nothing at all, sir," said Mr. Stocker in a
whisper. "Only I rather wanted to have a word with
you&mdash;in private&mdash;if you wouldn't mind sparing me
five minutes. Might I come in?"</p>

<p>"By all means," said Gilbert, wondering what the
little man wanted. "Sorry I can't offer you a seat&mdash;but
the ground's dry, and I'm used to it myself."</p>

<p>"Nice little place," said Stocker, looking round it,
and then lowering himself to the ground. "For my
part, sir, I often feel that in a way this is really very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
much superior to Clapham. No one to call after you
from the front door when you're going out that you
haven't got your gloves on, or that you've got one
trouser leg turned up and the other down (not that I
would wish to express any disrespect to Mrs. Stocker
for a moment; the very best of wives, sir). And then
again you don't have to take a cheap return to the
seaside; you've got it on the premises, as it were.
Of course, you don't get the niggers, or little entertainments
of that kind; but, after all, niggers ain't
everything."</p>

<p>"You had something rather important to say to
me," Gilbert reminded him.</p>

<p>Mr. Stocker put a finger to his lips, and appeared
to be listening intently; nodded his head with relief
after a moment or so; and motioned to Byfield to sit
down beside him. Then suddenly and unexpectedly,
and with a note of triumph in his tones, he made a
dramatic announcement&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir&mdash;it's not an island at all!"</p>

<p>All sorts of wild suggestions flitted through Byfield's
brain. There was of course the possibility that
Pringle, after all, had betrayed the secret; there was
the further possibility that Mr. Edward Stocker, in
some early morning excursion, had discovered it for
himself. Quite mechanically, Gilbert returned an
evasive answer.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I don't understand you," he said.
"What makes you say the place isn't an island?"</p>

<p>Mr. Stocker ventured to lay a hand on the other's
arm; in his excitement he raised his voice a little.
"This morning I went for a walk round the island,
and it occurred to me that I would like to climb the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
rocks at the further end&mdash;partly by way of a little
pleasing exercise, and partly because I thought that
if I gained the top I should be able to see much farther
than I should while down below. With considerable
difficulty I gained the top, grazing myself a
good deal in the process. There was only a narrow
ledge to which I could cling, but the air was clear, and
the view very fine. I repeat, sir," he added impressively&mdash;"the
view was very fine."</p>

<p>"Of a wide expanse of sea?" asked Gilbert.</p>

<p>"No, sir; of a certain expanse of sea, and, quite
near to me&mdash;land&mdash;and civilized land at that. I
distinctly saw the roofs of houses, with smoke coming
from them; I saw a bridge&mdash;and I saw many other
things to indicate that we are quite close to a sort of
civilization, however primitive. There was a little
strip of land that was almost covered by water; but
as the tide was rising I should imagine that that strip
of land is not covered at all at low water."</p>

<p>Gilbert was silent for what seemed a long time;
then out of the darkness of the little hut he spoke.
"Well&mdash;I suppose you've told everybody about it?"
he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, no," replied Mr. Stocker, with what
seemed to be a little chuckle. "I haven't said a word
all day about it; I've been waiting until I could catch
you alone, and tell you about it."</p>

<p>"I knew it some days ago," said Gilbert calmly.
"But I had my own reasons for saying nothing.
Now I am in your hands, and you have a perfect
right to tell anyone you like&mdash;to let the whole company
walk ashore, in fact, with the least possible delay."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, you see, sir&mdash;that's just my difficulty,"
said Edward Stocker gravely. "Of course I know
that everybody ought to be told&mdash;and everybody
ought to go back to their own particular walk in
life, after having had a rather good little holiday.
But you see, sir, it means that Mrs. Stocker and me
would go straight back to Clapham, where I've no
doubt the girl (if she thinks we're still alive) has been
using my credit to live upon, and has been keeping
the little house properly and respectably. It's a nice
house, as houses go&mdash;hot and cold water, and a bit
of garden back and front, and so forth; but after
all it is a house."</p>

<p>"And doubtless you will be glad to go back to it,"
said Gilbert.</p>

<p>"Not exactly, sir&mdash;quite between ourselves, of
course. You see, Mrs. Stocker and me, while rubbing
along in a manner of speaking from the first of January
until the end of the year pretty tolerably, might
sometimes hit it off a good deal better together than
what we do; that is to say, in Clapham. Now here,
sir, on the contrary, we've done rather well; Mrs.
Stocker has developed no edges to speak of&mdash;and the
island is a bit larger than my little bit of property at
Clapham, even with the front and back garden thrown
in. In other words, sir"&mdash;Edward Stocker lowered
his voice to a mere whisper&mdash;"in other words, I'm
able to dodge Mrs. S. rather easily here&mdash;and I've
had a better time than I've ever had in all my life before.
Consequently, sir, if you was to say to me at
the present moment&mdash;'Edward Stocker&mdash;be mum
about it, and forget that you ever saw that bit of
civilization beyond the rocks'&mdash;I should be the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
to take you by the hand, sir, (the liberty being excused)
and to say to you, sir&mdash;'Righto!'"</p>

<p>"Then that is exactly what I want you to do,"
said Gilbert. "For a little time, at least, until I
know what is going to happen to us all, I want everybody
to believe that we are stranded here, save for a
miracle, for the rest of our lives. Go back to bed, Mr.
Stocker, and sleep peacefully; unless you tell other
people yourself, they will never hear it from me."</p>

<p>"I'm sure I'm very much obliged, sir," said Mr.
Stocker, getting to his feet. "After all, sir, if the
winter comes on, or we get tired of it, we can always
find out quite by accident that there's a road by which
Mrs. Stocker and me can start off for Clapham; let's
hope it won't be soon, sir. Good night; I'm very
much obliged to you."</p>

<p>Gilbert was still laughing to himself over the extraordinary
reason given by Stocker for a further
sojourn on the island when the apology for a curtain
which covered the doorway of the hut was pulled aside,
and he saw Jordan Tant looking down at him. After
a moment of silence Tant came in, and stood leaning
against a tree which formed one of the supports of
the hut, staring moodily at Gilbert over his folded
arms. In these days it was a sturdier, healthier-looking
Mr. Tant, and his fair beard and moustache
rather suited him.</p>

<p>"I like always to be strictly honest, Byfield," he
began abruptly, "and therefore I begin at once by
saying that I have been playing the eavesdropper. It
was accidental; because I heard voices just as I got
up to the hut, and then I was so interested that I
didn't seem to be able to tear myself away. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
have every right to speak strongly about the matter,
but I beg that you will refrain until you have heard
me."</p>

<p>"How much did you hear?" asked Gilbert, feeling
that now indeed the game was ended, and that he was
at the mercy of this chatterer.</p>

<p>"Practically everything," replied Jordan Tant.
"The first I heard was the surprising announcement
by the man Stocker that this place was not an island&mdash;a
statement afterwards corroborated by yourself.
So far as that is concerned, I may be said to resemble
the man Stocker, because I too have to make an
appeal to you."</p>

<p>"An appeal?"</p>

<p>Mr. Tant nodded slowly. "It is one to which I
would ask you to lend a generous ear, because it is
one which affects not only myself but another person
also. I refer of course to Enid&mdash;and I refer to her
with the utmost delicacy. That young lady has been
placed in a most equivocal position; she has been compelled
to dress in garments totally unsuited to her
position in the world; she has been compelled to live in
caves and in rude constructions of timber. Consequently,
whatever is done in regard to that young lady
must be done with the utmost delicacy. Surely you
see that?" Mr. Tant put his head on one side, and
thoughtfully pulled at his new beard.</p>

<p>"I see it from the lady's point of view, of course,"
replied Gilbert. "But I don't quite see where the
appeal comes in, so far as you're concerned."</p>

<p>"I will explain," said Jordan Tant eagerly. "You
must know that when I was in London Enid looked
coldly upon me&mdash;probably because I really did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
shine in a civilized place. There was nothing romantic
about me then; <i>you</i> were the one to whom she turned,
naturally, because you did things rather out of the
common. Since we have been in this place, however,
she seems to have discovered in me qualities which had
before lain dormant. She has hinted as much more
than once, when we have been sitting in front of her
rude dwelling-place at night. I will not say that the
moon has had nothing to do with it; nevertheless, the
fact remains that she is much more partial to me&mdash;I
mean, of course, Enid, and not the moon&mdash;since we
have been in this place. Perhaps my dog-like fidelity
in keeping guard over her sleeping-place has touched
her; at all events, she has given a promise that she will
consider my claims, and will in all probability consider
them favourably."</p>

<p>"I'm delighted to hear it, my dear fellow," Gilbert
replied. "But what appeal have you to make to
me?"</p>

<p>"Not to let her know that this place is not really
an island, and that she can escape at any moment,"
urged Jordan Tant. "Here, my dear Byfield, I am a
person of importance&mdash;a man to be leant upon, and
to be trusted in an emergency; she leans upon, and
she trusts me. Take me back to London, and I become
at once a well-dressed atom that rides in cabs
and takes afternoon tea; there would be nothing
heroic about me there at all."</p>

<p>"But, my dear Tant&mdash;you can't remain here for
ever," said Gilbert.</p>

<p>"I do not ask to remain here for ever," retorted
Jordan Tant. "I ask to be allowed to remain here&mdash;keeping
Enid in ignorance&mdash;until such time as she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
shall have promised to share what she believes to be
an everlasting exile with me. She is a woman of her
word, and once she promises to love me I can safely
pass beyond the barrier of rocks, reach the mainland,
and marry her with due propriety. If she were to
discover now that in a sense she has been cheated, she
would believe that I had been guilty of the deception.
In other words, my dear Byfield, I am very near to
winning her, in my present bold, bearded, and badly-dressed
character; and it is the only real chance I
have ever had."</p>

<p>"Very well, Tant&mdash;I am already pledged not to
reveal the secret&mdash;so you can proceed with your
wooing as long as you like. And I wish you luck."</p>

<p>Mr. Jordan Tant felt for the other's hand in the
darkness, and wrung it hard. "It's the real romance
of the thing that touches her," he said solemnly.
"The shipwreck&mdash;and the stores washed ashore&mdash;and
the camp fire at night&mdash;and so forth. When we
do get back to London it'll be so very nice, because we
shall have quite enough to talk about for the rest of
our lives. Think of the difference: in the old days I
was not considered brilliant at all at dinner parties
and so forth; now I shall be able to tell of how we
nearly cast lots to decide which of us should be eaten."</p>

<p>"I'm glad it never came to that," said Gilbert, with
a laugh.</p>

<p>"I may tell you in confidence, my dear Byfield,"
said Tant, coming nearer to him for a moment in the
darkness&mdash;"in the strictest confidence, of course,
that Enid has already assured me that had the lot
fallen upon myself, nothing would have induced her
to do anything other than starve on my account. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
think that's rather touching. Good night&mdash;and
thank you!"</p>

<p>So it came about that the strange game was kept
alive for yet a few days longer. Dread of what the
girl might say or do when she heard of the deception
that had been practised upon her, and when she saw
clearly before her the way of escape, held Gilbert
silent; he knew, too, that those who had already
penetrated the secret would for their own purposes
say nothing. More than once he was in a mind to tell
Bessie everything, and to throw himself upon her
mercy; but he had blundered too often before to
care to make the experiment. She, for her part, with
no particular care nor thought of the future, had her
own secret to keep; she met him night after night in
the wood&mdash;binding him to her more closely at each
meeting with her innocence and her gentleness, and
her tenderness for him. For now, when at last it
seemed that they were both in the same helpless position,
she did not hesitate to tell him frankly and
fearlessly what was in her heart, and what had been
in her heart so long. And even while he made up his
mind that with the next moment she should learn the
truth, she silenced him all unconsciously by whispering
that now for the first time in her life she was happy&mdash;that
now all doubts and fears had been swept
away. It was all impossible&mdash;idyllic&mdash;absurd; yet
he clung to the vague hope that they might make-believe
a little longer yet.</p>

<p>The utter impossibility of the whole business was
sprung upon them when Mr. Daniel Meggison stepped
jauntily in, and pricked the bubble. It had not seemed
possible that that wily old schemer should be able to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
discover anything; but Meggison had been cunningly
setting his wits to work to discover some way of escape
from the island.</p>

<p>For him were no dreams and no romance; his exile
here was marked only by the fact that he was sternly
deprived of stimulants. He knew that Pringle had in
charge some spirits, rigorously withheld until such
time as they might be wanted for medicinal purposes;
and it is safe to assert that Daniel Meggison had
practised every art, and had pleaded every complaint
known to science, in a vain endeavour to extract them
from Pringle's custody. But he had failed; and for
that reason had set himself to watch, in the hope
that Pringle might be absent on one occasion, and so
leave the way open for a direct theft.</p>

<p>It was in that spirit that he awoke early one morning,
and crept out of the large hut, leaving his companions
sleeping. In this particular instance he was
rewarded; for he saw not only Pringle but Gilbert
Byfield stealing away through the shadows of the
dawn towards the north of the island. Curiosity
overcame every other consideration, and Daniel
Meggison stealthily followed.</p>

<p>It was, of course, a shopping excursion to the village.
Gilbert and Pringle hurried on their way, and
crossed the narrow neck of land; Mr. Daniel Meggison
rounded the corner of the rocks, and gasped, and
saw freedom before him. He followed them at a discreet
distance, and disappeared in the village; then,
the better to enjoy his triumph, returned to the
bridge, and seated himself there, and waited. And
while he waited he gazed smilingly at the dawn
through a bottle he held up before one eye.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>Gilbert Byfield and Pringle, toiling up to the
bridge, came upon him, and stopped in amazement;
Daniel Meggison winked at them knowingly. His
face was flushed, and he had about him some of the old
swagger that had been seen in Arcadia Street.</p>

<p>"Splendid notion!" he said, pointing at the village
and then at the distant line of rocks&mdash;"quite the
best game of all, my dear Byfield. I beg you'll keep it
up. I was so fortunate as to find an early morning
house; charmingly easy manners the Irish have.
Trust me, my dear Byfield&mdash;I won't say a word.
Splendid notion!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII<br />

<small>MISS MAKE-BELIEVE ESCAPES</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>THE discreet Pringle, as on one other memorable
occasion, had seated himself on the box in the
middle of the road out of earshot; Daniel Meggison,
lounging not too steadily against the parapet of the
bridge, addressed Gilbert.</p>

<p>"When I cast my mind back, sir, over the past, I
find myself marvelling&mdash;marvelling is the correct
word&mdash;at the splendid fashion in which you have
kept the game alive for the sake of my child. For
what," went on Mr. Meggison, waving a hand towards
the sky, and addressing the landscape generally&mdash;"for
what have you not done on her account?
The splendid prodigality of it amazes me. In the first
place, you give up to her a house in the country&mdash;to
which, quite naturally, she brings her family, to say
nothing of other relatives and friends who trespass
upon her. From that we fly"&mdash;Daniel Meggison
made a movement with his hands flutteringly in the air
to suggest that flying&mdash;"to a well-appointed yacht,
where perhaps at the beginning all is not as well as it
might be. Reckless of the consequences&mdash;careless of
the results to life, limb and property&mdash;you splendidly
drive that vessel upon the rocks; you annex&mdash;(annex
is the proper word, I believe)&mdash;a portion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
country that is probably not your own property; declare
it to be an island; and in the most romantic
fashion provision the company cast upon it with you.
In a word, sir, the thing is magnificent&mdash;even if
carried a little too far."</p>

<p>"I firmly believed it to be an island until a few days
ago," said Gilbert. "I, like others, have been deceived;
I, like others, have been driven on a road I
never meant to travel. Great things and great consequences
have sprung from my small beginnings."</p>

<p>"Nobly said, sir!" exclaimed Daniel Meggison.
"But what I would ask is&mdash;why give the game
away now?" He lowered his voice to a whisper, and
took a step towards the younger man. "You've
played the game splendidly; play it a little longer.
Here is a village&mdash;ready and willing to supply all
our needs; here is a pleasant land, where we may pass
the summer, or what remains of it, in idyllic simplicity.
Why change anything? For my own part,
I needed but little to complete my personal happiness,
and that little I have found. Your credit here, sir&mdash;or
the credit of your servant&mdash;is particularly well
established; they bow before your name, sir."</p>

<p>"Are you another of them anxious to keep the
fraud going?" asked Gilbert in amazement.</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir," replied the unabashed Daniel
Meggison. "In a primitive fashion I am very happy
here: what will happen when the winter comes on is of
course quite another matter. But let the future take
care of itself; for the moment we are children, and we
laugh in the sunshine."</p>

<p>"The tide's turning, sir," said Pringle, getting up
from his box, and preparing to shoulder it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm afraid the tide has turned for me," said
Gilbert with a sigh, as he moved away.</p>

<p>Daniel Meggison was very merry over breakfast
that morning. He chose to be flippant with Gilbert,
and to rally Pringle on the ease with which these
islands could really be inhabited when it came to the
pinch. Dubbing himself the new Crusoe, he declared
his intention of searching the shore that very morning,
in the hope to find that solitary footprint of a
possible Man Friday. He asked Gilbert whether it
would not be wise to set about at once the building of
a stockade, the better to protect themselves against
the possible incursion of a dusky foe. Altogether
Daniel Meggison enjoyed the situation mightily, and
bore himself with that easy flippant gaiety that had
marked him out in the Arcadia Arms as being above
the common herd. He displayed his power by openly
asking Gilbert if he had ever been to the west coast of
Ireland, and if so, what he thought of the scenery.</p>

<p>But it was by a combination of circumstances that
the secret was at last exposed to those who already
were not in possession of it; and when the exposure
came at last, it seemed to come in the strangest way
from several quarters. In the first place, Daniel Meggison,
growing bolder, walked across that narrow
neck of land one morning, and spent the day in the
village, or in an adjacent one, being regarded by the
inhabitants as a species of amiable tramp who had
drifted out of the great Unknown to enliven the
monotony of their existence. As ill-luck would have
it, however, he drifted down across the bridge to the
shore again, blissfully forgetful of the fact that the
tide only served at certain hours, and discovered that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
he was cut off for the night. Drifting back again, he
made a bed for himself in an outhouse, and slept the
night away.</p>

<p>But to Bessie his disappearance was a great and
inexplicable disaster. She had been in the habit, even
as in the old days of Arcadia Street, of bidding him
good night, and asking the question&mdash;futile here&mdash;whether
she could do anything more for him. But
this night he was missing; and an inquiry in various
directions among that very scanty population of the
island revealed the fact that nothing had been seen of
him since early morning.</p>

<p>Gilbert had his suspicions, of course, and so had
Pringle; but Bessie was frantic with anxiety. A thousand
things, in her imagination, might have happened
to him; he might have climbed the rocks and fallen
into the sea, or he might have fallen asleep on the
shore and been carried away by the waves. At all
events, the most exhaustive inquiry failed to find him
within the limited circumference of the island; and
Bessie was suddenly a new power to be reckoned
with.</p>

<p>Those who were the head and front of the actual
conspiracy came to Gilbert that night&mdash;drifting to
him guiltily and secretly one after the other. Mr.
Edward Stocker came first; and Mr. Edward Stocker
was vaguely apologetic for his wife's brother.</p>

<p>"An anxiety to the family at all times, sir," said
Mr. Stocker. "Clever man, of course, with much
more dignity and much more of real gentlemanly feeling
than ever I had, or am likely to have. Bit of
genius in his way, sir." Mr. Stocker paused, and
thoughtfully pulled at one ear as he looked at Gilbert.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
"I suppose it isn't necessary to ask where he's gone,
sir?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid not," replied the other. "He penetrated
the secret of this place a little time back;
he's making the most of his new freedom on the mainland&mdash;and
I expect he's been cut off by the tide.
He's safe enough; but it means that we must tell
Bessie."</p>

<p>"I suppose so," said Mr. Stocker, with a long face.
"And that also means that Mrs. Stocker and me will
go back to Clapham. Well," he added, with a sigh&mdash;"the
best of holidays must end."</p>

<p>Mr. Stocker had perhaps more gentlemanly feeling
after all than he imagined; at the very moment of
departure from Gilbert's hut he came back to him, to
make a little set speech that had been in his mind
evidently from the first. "I should like to say, sir, on
behalf of self and Mrs. Stocker (although Mrs.
Stocker may not think it absolutely necessary to speak
for herself), I should like to say that we take it kind
that people who force themselves on a gent like you,
without so much as 'by your leave,' should have been
so treated as I may say we have been. It isn't everyone
that would go and put up with people that shoved
themselves on him, and insisted on being shipwrecked
with him&mdash;and even on being supported, like the
early Christians, in rocks and caves of the earth. On
behalf of self and Mrs. Stocker&mdash;I am very thankful,
sir."</p>

<p>Mr. Jordan Tant came up the hill jubilantly
enough; he carried his head almost defiantly. He was
still a yard or two away, in fact, when he burst out
with his great news.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>"She accepts me! As I predicted, she accepts
me!"</p>

<p>"That's not the most important thing on earth,"
retorted Gilbert. "What about this wretched old man
who has suddenly disappeared, as his daughter supposes,
and who will force us to tell the secret, and
explain the false position in which we stand?"</p>

<p>"That scarcely matters to me now," said Tant.
"My dear Enid is a woman of her word, and although
I may be forced to return to civilization, she will I
know go with me&mdash;understanding me better for the
way in which I have risen to the occasion during our
dangers and privations. She will say to herself&mdash;'If
this man can behave in such a fashion amid unknown
perils, and with the sea roaring and leaping
about us&mdash;what will he not be like in the neighbourhood
of a mere tame Hyde Park or Kensington
Gardens?' That's what she will say; that's what
she's already saying. Consequently, my dear Byfield,
I don't mind how soon I go back to civilization."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;you've won your woman; you can afford
to play the deserter now," retorted Gilbert. "Go, by
all means; I have a vision of you and Mrs. Ewart-Crane
and the fair Enid, incongruously dressed, stepping
daintily across to the mainland&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Where I shall immediately telegraph news of my
safety, and proceed to buy a few rough garments with
the money I still have, and which it has been impossible
for me to spend in this place," broke in Jordan Tant.
"Above all things, Byfield, I shall cherish the remembrance
that in a fair and open field, when reduced
almost to the condition of primitive men, I won her
from you, as the better man. I always knew it; I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
always certain that in me were qualities undeveloped
by the artificial life I had led."</p>

<p>"You can believe that if you will," said Gilbert,
laughing. "As for myself, the bottom seems to have
dropped out of everything I ever contemplated doing,
and I am living here a more artificial life than ever I
lived in London. Take your way out into the world,
my Tant&mdash;and be happy."</p>

<p>Meanwhile there were other happenings. Mr.
Edward Stocker had deemed himself safe from his
formidable spouse, and had perhaps grown a little
careless under his new liberty; but it happened that
on that particular night, when the little man had
climbed the hill to Gilbert's hut, Mrs. Stocker had
thought it prudent to follow him. She had marked
his absence on other occasions; she who had forced
from him every secret his unromantic life had known
determined that she would force from him now any
knowledge he possessed outside that she herself held.
She listened outside the hut, and heard that talk of
the mainland and of the absent Daniel Meggison;
when Mr. Stocker, after his set speech, cautiously
scrambled down the hill, Mrs. Stocker, scratching
herself with briers, and gasping as she stumbled over
the rough earth, followed him. Bessie being absent
from the hut, Mrs. Stocker suddenly pounced upon
Mr. Stocker, to his great alarm, and dragged him
into that portion of the hut hitherto occupied by
Bessie Meggison and herself.</p>

<p>"My dear&mdash;I've been for a little walk," faltered
Edward Stocker, looking at her with a faint smile.</p>

<p>"Plotter and schemer!&mdash;so you thought you
would keep everything from your Julia&mdash;did you?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
she demanded, in a suppressed voice. "You had no
objection to your wife being made a guy of for the
amusement of those who consider themselves superior
in station; you didn't care if she lived in a sort of
cattle shed, without so much as a scrap of looking-glass
or a comb for weeks on end; you didn't mind if
she had to endure the pity of women who never really
look anything at all unless they are dressed to death!
What's this talk of the island and the mainland; and
where is my brother?"</p>

<p>"My dear&mdash;we've really been very comfortable
here," pleaded Edward Stocker. "It's been quite a
new experience&mdash;the sort of holiday to talk to our
friends about long years afterwards."</p>

<p>"I dare say," she sniffed. "Friends who have enjoyed
the privileges of Margate or Ramsgate, or even
Brighton, and worn respectable clothing with the best&mdash;with
a special blouse for dinner in the evening.
Holiday, indeed! I shall never be able to hold up my
head again as long as I live."</p>

<p>"I'm extremely sorry," said Mr. Stocker. "What
would you like me to do?"</p>

<p>"The moment this tide or whatever it is turns, you
will conduct me to the mainland. There, after we
have procured proper clothing, you will discover the
best way to reach Clapham; and for the rest of your
life you will remain there&mdash;respectably. No more
gadding about after people with whom one is not
really concerned. And don't you ever dare, Edward
Stocker, to refer to this time as a holiday!"</p>

<p>Late though it was, Mrs. Edward Stocker, primed
with this new knowledge, set out to impart it to the
lady she had hitherto regarded as her foe. Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
Ewart-Crane should understand that Mrs. Stocker
was no mere ordinary woman, to be imposed upon;
Mrs. Ewart-Crane should be impressed with the fact
that Mrs. Stocker had sprung into the very heart of
the secret, and had in fact, if it came to that, suspected
the truth from the first. Binding the trembling
Edward Stocker to her with a fierce command,
she set out to find Mrs. Ewart-Crane.</p>

<p>She performed the visit with all due ceremony;
apologized profusely and yet with dignity for a call
which she knew was not strictly in accordance with the
usages of polite society; and then, in a most casual
manner, declared that she had at last been able to
verify the suspicion that she had entertained for a
long time.</p>

<p>"In fact, for some inexplicable reason, we have
been kept here, when we might have escaped at any
moment. The whole thing is one gigantic hoax, and
I am surprised that anyone should have been taken
in by it for a moment," said Mrs. Stocker loftily.
"Personally, I have had reasons for remaining here,
not altogether unconnected with relatives of my own;
but I see no further necessity for enduring discomfort
when I can quite easily get home."</p>

<p>"I am extremely sorry that you should have had
the trouble to call at this hour," retorted Mrs. Ewart-Crane,
shaking out her print dress more gracefully
about her. "But I was informed some time ago of the
extraordinary fact you have related. Our friend Mr.
Jordan Tant knows all about it. We shall of course
return to London at once. We were brought into this
discreditable business greatly against my wish, and
the sooner we have done with it the better I shall be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
pleased. Good night, ma'am&mdash;and pray take care
of your husband; he doesn't look strong."</p>

<p>Mrs. Stocker led Edward Stocker back to the hut,
commenting fiercely upon the manners of the upper
classes, and upon the airs they gave themselves. On
second thoughts she decided that, once back in her
Clapham home, she might reasonably expand the adventures
on this supposed island; might come near
to starvation and that casting of lots that had been
threatened; and might be rescued in the nick of time
and in the last stage of exhaustion by a friendly
vessel, flying a foreign flag, the captain of which
was not altogether unimpressed by her charms. Also
she determined that the island should be placed in a
situation very remote from the British Isles.</p>

<p>Pringle sought his master in the hope of having
some new light thrown upon this strange development
of the story. Single-hearted as to purpose, so far
as Byfield was concerned, Pringle had held obstinately
to that fact he had set before himself at the first: that
the place was an island. Now, in a moment, it seemed
that there was no hope of that fiction being kept alive;
he desired fresh instructions as to how to deal with the
problem before him.</p>

<p>"Asking your pardon, sir, for interfering," he
said&mdash;"but I suppose you understand that this
won't be the end of it, by no means. Mr. Meggison,
sir, has been lured away in search of things he couldn't
find here, sir&mdash;and I'm afraid the others'll follow.
I've done my best from the very first; I wouldn't have
you think otherwise, sir."</p>

<p>"I know you've done your best, Pringle," replied
Gilbert, laughing ruefully&mdash;"but that doesn't mend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
matters. The thing has gone beyond Mr. Daniel
Meggison; there are others already who know it. You
have played your part of the game admirably,
Pringle; but unfortunately I shall be supposed to
have played it with you from the very beginning. So
far as Mr. Meggison is concerned, let him stay on the
mainland, or let him come back; personally, I should
be glad if both he and his son had gone altogether.
The others are free to go when they like, because I'm
afraid that the sorry game is played out. It isn't
your fault, Pringle, because if it comes to that you
played your game better than any of us."</p>

<p>"Much obliged to you, sir, for your good opinion,"
said Pringle. "If it would ease matters at all, I'd
take the boat and row across, and bring Mr. Meggison
back&mdash;by force if necessary, sir."</p>

<p>"That wouldn't do at all; but we must invent some
story to allay Miss Meggison's anxiety."</p>

<p>"If I might make so bold, sir&mdash;wouldn't it be better
to tell her the truth? She's the best of the whole
bunch, sir&mdash;again asking your pardon for the
liberty&mdash;and I'm sure she'd understand, sir."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you're right, Pringle; in any case something
has to be done, and that without delay."</p>

<p>That thought was in the mind of Pringle as he
walked back towards his own quarters. Counting
over in his mind the various people who had been so
strangely brought together in that place, he came
with particular dislike to a recollection of Mr. Aubrey
Meggison&mdash;that coarse-mannered youth who had
consistently refused to assist in any work on the island,
and who had always taken growlingly his full
share of all the food and clothing that were to be had.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
It might be a good idea to rid this harassed master of
his of the son as well as of the father.</p>

<p>Fortune played into his hands. He was sitting by
the last remains of the fire when he heard steps, and,
looking up, saw the man of whom he had been thinking
staring moodily down at him. Pringle looked up, and
nodded cheerfully, and spoke with that deep respect
with which he spoke to all men.</p>

<p>"Good evening, sir," said Pringle cheerfully.
"Bad business, sir&mdash;this about your guv'nor."</p>

<p>"A very mysterious business," said Aubrey darkly.
"If I was in London, I should have a word or two to
say about what the police had been doin'; I should let
'em know what I thought about the matter&mdash;and I
should point out a theory or two, to put 'em on the
right track. You can't deceive me, you know; I
wasn't born yesterday, not by a long chalk."</p>

<p>"I can quite believe it, sir," said Pringle. "Now,
what might be your theory, sir?&mdash;or, if left to yourself,
how would you set about finding this guv'nor of
yours, sir?"</p>

<p>Mr. Aubrey Meggison lowered himself to the
ground, and, resting a hand on each knee, leaned
forward towards Pringle. "My opinion," he said
solemnly, "is that the guv'nor was in the way&mdash;another
mouth to feed, you'll understand&mdash;and he's
been made away with." Aubrey leaned back, and
nodded slowly three times.</p>

<p>"Now, I should never have thought of that, sir,"
said Pringle.</p>

<p>"Nor anybody else that hadn't knocked about the
world as I have, and seen things," said Aubrey composedly.
"Mind, I'm not sayin' that in a way it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
doesn't serve the guv'nor right; he hasn't played
what you might call the gentleman since we've been
'ere. At the same time, you see, he's my father&mdash;and
as fathers go he wasn't bad. At the same time,
justice is justice, and I want to know what's become
of the old man."</p>

<p>"If you'll excuse the saying, sir," said Pringle,
with deep respect&mdash;"you're smart&mdash;but your
father's smarter. That's putting it in the rough,
sir; but you've not been fairly dealt with, sir, and
I should like to speak my mind to you."</p>

<p>"You're probably mistaken, you know," said Aubrey&mdash;"but
you can go on."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," said Pringle. "You must
know, then, that your father has discovered that there
is a way of escape from this place&mdash;and he has taken
that way."</p>

<p>"Come&mdash;no bunkum, you know," said Aubrey.
"You can't gammon me; I'm much too fly."</p>

<p>"It would be waste of breath to try to, sir," replied
Pringle. "But your father has discovered,
quite by accident, what no one else knows; he has
found out that this place is not an island at all, but
is connected with the mainland. Consequently, sir,
to that mainland he has gone; and I expect at the
present moment he's got his toes stuck up in front of
a very decent fire, sir&mdash;with a glass of something
in his hand, and I shouldn't be surprised if there was
a cigar in the other."</p>

<p>Aubrey Meggison slowly got to his knees, and
leaned forward, and stared in blank amazement at
the placid Pringle. "You don't mean to say that
while all these mugs are rottin' about here, playin'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
shipwrecks, the guv'nor's gone and found a little
place for himself, where he can be nice and comfortable?
Don't tell me that the old man's gone one better
than anybody else!" he pleaded.</p>

<p>"Unhappily it's a fact, sir. He's living on the fat
of the land," said Pringle.</p>

<p>Aubrey got up, and walked round the fire, swearing
softly to himself as he went. Then he stopped,
and looked down at Pringle, and began to laugh;
shook his head whimsically more than once, and
slapped his thigh, and danced about a little.</p>

<p>"By George!&mdash;he's a wonder!" he exclaimed, in
a tone of deep admiration. "I've always been proud
of him in a way; never minded tippin' him the nod
in a billiard-room or anything of that kind, because
he wasn't quite like other chaps' guv'nors. But to
think of him slipping off like that and having a good
time&mdash;&mdash; I tell you what it is&mdash;my old guv'nor
would make a jolly good livin' at the North Pole,
without a relief expedition. He's a living wonder!"</p>

<p>"He's a very remarkable man, sir," supplemented
Pringle.</p>

<p>"But I'll bowl him over; I'll show him that two
can play at that game," said Aubrey, with a chuckle.
"You show me what's the best way to get off this
blessed place&mdash;same as father's done&mdash;and I'll ferret
out the old man, and stand before him, and show
him that two can play at that game as well as one.
All's well that ends well, don't you know; when I've
got a good old cigar in between my teeth, and something
a little stronger than water ready to my hand,
I shall feel like a man again!"</p>

<p>Pringle, delighted with the success of his scheme,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
arranged an early meeting at the point where the
rocks jutted into the sea. That appointment (surprisingly
enough for one who hated early rising)
was kept by Aubrey Meggison; and on the way
across the narrow neck of land the youth chuckled
to himself at the ease with which it had been possible
all along to reach the mainland. On the opposite
shore he turned to Pringle impressively.</p>

<p>"Don't you run away with the idea, my man, that
you've got rid of us," he said; "we're not so easy
shaken off as that. I know the guv'nor, and I also
know myself; and we shall have just a word to say,
if necessary, to the person that placed us in this
position. I don't think I need enlarge on the subject;
if you want to understand my feelings just cast your
eye over my clothes. This Mr. Byfield has trotted
us about for his own convenience; he needn't think
he's going to dump us anywhere, and leave us to shift
for ourselves. I'm going to find the guv'nor, and I'm
going to make myself comfortable with him. So
long!"</p>

<p>Pringle stood to watch him climbing over the
bridge; shook his head over his departing figure with
an expression of disgust. "It's a rum thing, when
you come to think of it," murmured Pringle to himself&mdash;"it's
a mighty rum thing that that sort of
creature generally manages to get through the world,
and to get some one else to keep it. I suppose the
real reason is that it turns so nasty if it doesn't get
what it calls its rights, that it becomes pleasanter
for all parties just to pay it to keep quiet."</p>

<p>Bessie had gone, in her bewilderment and anxiety,
at last to Gilbert; to him she presented that mystery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
which was no mystery at all. What did he think had
become of her dear father?</p>

<p>Even then he held back from the truth; even then
he evaded the only explanation possible. "My
dear," he said gently, taking her hand, "I can only
assure you that your father is well&mdash;and safe."</p>

<p>"Then you know where he is?" she demanded
quickly.</p>

<p>"I can guess&mdash;and I can only tell you that it is
at the moment a little secret. You must trust me,
just as you have trusted me all through. You shall
know everything to-day; and everything shall be set
right to-day."</p>

<p>"Set right?" She looked at him in perplexity.
"Is anything wrong?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," he assured her. "You shall know
everything to-day, my darling; that at least I can
promise you. And your father is well."</p>

<p>She plied him with questions, but he would not
answer her. Truth to tell, he had not yet made up
his mind what to do; he seemed to see her, in imagination,
drifting again out of his life&mdash;refusing to
receive any explanation that he could offer. He
whispered of his love for her&mdash;of all that they might
do together in some impossible future, when they
should have been rescued from that place. She listened
with only a vague understanding of what he
said; doubts were in her mind already as to what
was happening, and why it should be necessary to
keep her in ignorance concerning her father. She
loved Gilbert&mdash;she thought she understood him; but
passionately she declared to herself that she had been
tricked once, and she would not be tricked again. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
strove hard to keep an open mind; strove to remind
herself that what he did was done for her sake, and
out of his love for her. But he had sworn to tell her
the truth always, and to cheat her no more; and to
that he must keep steadfastly. There must be no
second path.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a series of personally conducted tours
were taking place, under the guidance of Pringle.
To Pringle each party appeared&mdash;and to him each
party appealed. Mrs. Stocker, leading the obedient
Stocker, demanded to be shown the way; the obliging
Pringle, feeling that here at last was a solution
of the great difficulty, willingly conducted the pair
round the rocks&mdash;and pointed the way. He watched
them climbing where Aubrey had climbed but a little
time before&mdash;incongruous-looking figures, facing
the dawn and going back into the world. Also he
carried in his mind, as a message not to be delivered,
certain parting words spoken by Mrs. Stocker.</p>

<p>"You may tell your master," that lady had said
at the last moment, "that I am not likely to forget
the position in which he has placed a lady who has
hitherto been able to hold up her head with the very
best in the most select part of Clapham. I am not
sure that my husband will not lay the matter before
his solicitors, with a view to a claim for damages.
Do you understand?"</p>

<p>"I will bear it in mind, ma'am," said Pringle
humbly.</p>

<p>"I am given to understand that we are probably
on the western coast of Ireland, which is much the
same as being cast among savages," went on the
lady. "In any case the return fare to Clapham<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
Junction (the station nearest our home), to say nothing
of garments to be purchased, will be considerable;
a claim shall be duly posted to your master, and must
be met forthwith. So far as moral damage is concerned,
I will consult with my husband, as I have
suggested, and Mr. Byfield will doubtless receive a
communication in due course."</p>

<p>"Very good, ma'am," said Pringle. "Go straight
across, ma'am, and keep to the road. Nice little village,
and pleasant people. Good morning!"</p>

<p>Pringle was turning away, not troubling for once
to conceal his laughter, when he was met by the second
party, consisting of Mr. Jordan Tant, Mrs.
Ewart-Crane, and Enid. Pringle straightened his
face, and gave them at once a cheerful but respectful
greeting.</p>

<p>"Good morning, sir," he said to Tant. "Are you
taking a walk, sir?"</p>

<p>"We are leaving this place, if it is at all possible,"
broke in Mrs. Ewart-Crane. "You can no longer
deceive us, my good man."</p>

<p>"Not for the world, ma'am," said Pringle. "In
fact, if you hurry a bit, there's just a chance you
may be able to get across before the tide turns.
Nice village, sir, just over the bridge; cheerful people.
This way, sir."</p>

<p>He watched them also disappear&mdash;splashing a
little in the middle of the neck of land, and with some
lifting of skirts on the part of the ladies. Then he
got back just in time himself, and set about the preparation
of breakfast, quite as though nothing unusual
had happened.</p>

<p>"Everybody's late this morning," commented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
Simon Quarle, as he took his place by the fire, and
nodded to Pringle. "Heard anything about Meggison?"</p>

<p>Pringle saw Bessie approaching, and merely shook
his head. The girl greeted Simon quietly; her face
was white and set, and she did not look round even
when Gilbert approached. Gilbert seemed a little
surprised to find that they were the only breakfasters;
a gloomy silence had settled upon them all.
Pringle was withdrawing as usual, to take his breakfast
a little apart, when Gilbert called him back.</p>

<p>"Pringle&mdash;have you called the others?"</p>

<p>Pringle looked uncomfortable, and gazed down into
the cup he was carrying. "Might I have a word
with you, sir?" he asked, without raising his eyes.</p>

<p>"You can speak now; there's nothing to hide,"
said Gilbert, watching the girl.</p>

<p>"Well, sir&mdash;very early this morning the ladies
and gentlemen made up their minds, sir, to go. It
seems that everybody understood, sir&mdash;they'd found
it out somehow or other, sir, and the delights of the
island no longer attracted them. They've gone, sir,
by the way you know."</p>

<p>"All of them?" Gilbert stared at the man incredulously.</p>

<p>"Every one of 'em, sir," replied the man. "First
it was Mr. Aubrey&mdash;longing to see his father&mdash;and
then it was Mr. and Mrs. Stocker&mdash;and then
Mr. Tant and the other ladies."</p>

<p>"That will do, Pringle&mdash;thank you," said Gilbert;
and the man walked a few paces away, and
seated himself on the ground, and began his breakfast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>"Gone? Where the devil have they gone?" demanded
Quarle, staring open-mouthed at Byfield. "I
want to understand. Where could they go to?"</p>

<p>Gilbert turned to the girl; there could be no
further delay.</p>

<p>"Bessie," he began gently&mdash;"you must understand
that this place is not, as we thought, an island
at all. At low tide it is connected with the mainland&mdash;and
that mainland is, I believe, Ireland. Your
father found that out, and was one of the first to
go back into civilization; the others have discovered
the secret, and have followed him. I did not know
until&mdash;until a day or two ago that this place was
not an island. I have been perfectly honest with you&mdash;up
to that time."</p>

<p>She did not take her eyes from his face; a chill
drop of doubt seemed to fall upon her heart, and to
deaden it. She got to her feet and walked away;
the two men, watching her, saw her suddenly stop,
and drop her face in her hands. Gilbert sprang to
his feet, and Simon Quarle scrambled up also.</p>

<p>"Bessie!" cried the younger man; and again as
he got nearer to her&mdash;"Bessie!"</p>

<p>She turned swiftly, and dropped her hands at her
sides, and faced him. "And all these people know
now that the thing has been a cheat&mdash;a lie from the
beginning. Just as we played at make-believe at
your house at Fiddler's Green&mdash;just as we played
at make-believe on the yacht&mdash;so we've played at
make-believe here. Is that true?"</p>

<p>He took a step towards her, and laid his hands
upon her shoulders; he felt her stiffen under his
touch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<p>"Bessie&mdash;my dear, dear girl&mdash;it's true&mdash;but
it wasn't my fault this time. I did indeed believe that
we were cast away here; I hadn't the remotest notion
of where we were at all. Then, when at last&mdash;only a
few days ago, comparatively speaking&mdash;I found
out that we could get back into civilization so easily,
I determined that I would keep the game alive a
little longer&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah!&mdash;the game&mdash;always the game!" she
breathed tearfully, and dropped her head.</p>

<p>"And I did that because I loved you; and because
I was afraid that you might stand before me as
you're standing now, and refuse to believe what I
told you. I wanted to keep you here a little longer&mdash;I
wanted to see you cheerfully playing make-believe
day after day; I didn't want you to go back
into the world&mdash;the common ordinary world again."</p>

<p>"And now the game is ended," she said, looking
up at him with eyes brimming with tears. "Take
your hands away from me, Mr. Byfield, please; the
game is ended. It has been a poor game from the
first&mdash;and God help me!&mdash;I've lost every time.
Take your hands away from me!"</p>

<p>He watched her go&mdash;standing miserably and
helplessly looking after her. He dared not follow;
he was afraid to think what she would do, or how
this poor comedy that had so strangely developed
into a tragedy was to end. Simon Quarle said nothing;
he stood grimly muttering a little to himself;
he seemed dazed by the sudden turn of events.</p>

<p>"An island&mdash;and not an island; and to think
that I never for a moment suspected it," muttered
Quarle. "And for me, at my time of life, to play<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
at shipwrecks and Robinson Crusoe and the devil
knows what! It's amazing!"</p>

<p>Strangely enough, Simon Quarle was to cut the
knot on this occasion. He had sought out Pringle,
and had got the real truth from him&mdash;understanding
only too well that it would be necessary to wait
until early morning if he would cross to the mainland.
He was wandering disconsolately on the shore when
Bessie approached him.</p>

<p>"Mr. Quarle&mdash;you were always my friend&mdash;weren't
you?" she pleaded, looking quickly round
about to see that they were not observed. "And
you're going to help me?"</p>

<p>He nodded. "With my life, if necessary, my
dear," he said, with an attempt at whimsicality.
"What are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"The boat will take us across to the mainland;
we need not wait another night here," she whispered
hurriedly. "Dear good kind old friend&mdash;take me
across&mdash;and set me free."</p>

<p>He nodded again, and turned away at once in the
direction of the boat, she following. Together they
shoved it into the water, and with sturdy strokes the
man pulled round the rocks and in the direction of the
mainland. As he helped her out, she suddenly bent,
and put her arms about his neck, and kissed him.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, old friend," she said, a little brokenly&mdash;"I'm
going to run away."</p>

<p>"You'll find the others all down in the village, I
expect," he reminded her.</p>

<p>She shook her head, and smiled through her tears.
"I'm not going to find the others; I couldn't bear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
to meet them," she replied. "I'm going to run away
into the world&mdash;all alone. Good-bye!"</p>

<p>"Stop!" he exclaimed, "you can't go like that."
But she waved her hand to him, and ran up towards
the bridge; turned there for a moment to wave her
hand again, and to blow a kiss in his direction. And
then ran on out of his sight, and down into the world.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX<br />

<small>THE LAMPS ARE LIT IN ARCADIA STREET</small></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>ARCADIA STREET, on a warm July evening
some twelve months after that surprising day
when Mr. Daniel Meggison had waved farewell to the
Arcadia Arms for ever, looked much the same as it
had ever done. Even the children who played wonderfully
with no toys on the pavement seemed to be
the same that had followed a certain Mr. Jordan
Tant, on the occasion of his first visit to the street;
and there were the same loungers (or others very like
them) propping up that institution so necessary to
Arcadia Street and the immediate neighbourhood&mdash;the
Arcadia Arms.</p>

<p>Even in the house where Bessie had once toiled and
struggled and dreamt there was a card propped up
against the window-frame, announcing that within
were rooms to let; quite as though that particular
house had been marked from the beginning for that
particular purpose, and could not change. Only in
these days the house did not wear quite that air of
neatness that it had worn when Bessie Meggison had
presided there.</p>

<p>It was growing late this July evening, and the dusk
was falling, and softening the outlines of the ugly
houses, when a four-wheeled cab, after a preliminary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
objection on the part of the horse to entering the
street at all, turned into Arcadia Street, and jerked
and bumped and rattled its way along, until it came
to a standstill at the door of that particular house.
As the then landlady of the house afterwards stated,
"it put her all of a quiver"&mdash;cabs of any sort
being rare indeed in Arcadia Street. On the top of
the cab were a couple of old and shabby portmanteaus,
and a small square wooden box; inside was
another box, and a smaller bag, and a young man.
The young man got out, and, pushing his way
through the small knot of children that had gathered
to watch the proceedings, knocked quickly at the
door, and then stood waiting. The cabman knelt
upon his seat, with a hand on the foremost of the
portmanteaus, and waited also.</p>

<p>Mrs. Laws&mdash;the landlady in question&mdash;a stout
and elderly woman with a chronic aversion to stairs&mdash;removed
her eyes from the window of the front
room, and crossed the room heavily, and went to open
the door. When it was opened the young man nodded
pleasantly, and indicated the card in the window.</p>

<p>"You have rooms to let?" he said. "I was walking
through here yesterday, and saw the card, and
thought the place might suit me."</p>

<p>"W'ich it's a sweet room, sir&mdash;or p'raps I should
say two rooms&mdash;one hopenin' out of the other&mdash;and
cheap at any price. On the second floor, sir&mdash;an'
if you cared to walk in&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thank you," said the young man. "I know the
sort of rooms; I'll take them, if the price is all right.
I can't afford very much&mdash;but I dare say we can
arrange that."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<p>It was arranged then and there&mdash;the landlady a
little surprised at the suddenness with which the
young man accepted an offer that was half a crown
in advance of what the landlady would really have
taken. The luggage was brought in, with the assistance
of the cabman, who turned on each occasion
as he got to the door with a box or a bag on his
shoulder to shout sternly at the horse&mdash;"Whoa!"&mdash;as
though that patient steed, apparently half
asleep, had made up its mind to seize the opportunity
to run away. Then the cabman was paid, and the cab
was gone; and the young man, after declining to have
any little thing cooked for him, was left in the shabby
room to himself. He shut the door, and looked about
him.</p>

<p>He was a tall young man, with broad shoulders,
and he was rather shabbily dressed. He presently
walked through into the back room, and looked out
over those apologies for gardens common to Arcadia
Street and other places; shrugged his shoulders, and
sighed a little, and shook his head.</p>

<p>"Just the same as ever&mdash;nothing changed, and
yet everything changed," he muttered. "All the
spirit of Arcadia Street&mdash;all that peopled it and
made it beautiful&mdash;is gone; there's no one left to
look for Fairyland within its limits. Well&mdash;it's as
good a place for a poor man to live in as any other;
and after all there are certain memories that float
about its grimy chimneys."</p>

<p>He was roused by a knock at the door of the other
room. Believing it to be the anxious Mrs. Laws with
another appeal to the new lodger to partake of food,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
he walked into that further room, and called out
somewhat impatiently&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come in!"</p>

<p>The door opened, and a man came in; nodded
grimly on seeing the young man, and closed the door
again. A thick-set man, with head thrust well forward
between his shoulders, and standing now with
his hands clasped behind his back. A man called
Simon Quarle.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Byfield&mdash;and what's brought you
back here?" asked Quarle suspiciously. "I heard
your voice on the stairs; also I happened to be looking
out of the window when you drove up. I should
have thought you had done with Arcadia Street long
ago."</p>

<p>Gilbert Byfield laughed, and held out his hand.
"Why treat me as an enemy still, Mr. Quarle?" he
asked pleasantly. "I always rather liked you, and
we've been through some curious adventures, one way
and another. Won't you shake hands?"</p>

<p>"I will&mdash;when I know what new game's afoot,"
said Quarle. "As I told you once, you have no place
in Arcadia Street; go back to your own world, and
stop there."</p>

<p>Gilbert dropped on one knee beside a portmanteau,
and began to unstrap it. "As a matter of fact,"
he said, "I think I have more right in Arcadia Street
even than you have."</p>

<p>"How's that?" asked Quarle.</p>

<p>"Well, if I remember rightly, you have something
of an income, even if it's a small one; I am under
the impression that you retired from something
or other, with just enough money to live upon."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

<p>"I did," said the other, with a nod. "I was
thrifty in my young days, and I saved up the pence."</p>

<p>"Well, I wasn't thrifty in my young days, and
I didn't save anything. Consequently"&mdash;Gilbert
looked up at him with a whimsical smile&mdash;"I have
now no money at all, except such as I may be able
to earn. All my affairs have gone to smash, Mr.
Quarle; I've come to Arcadia Street, because in the
old days I found it cheap, when I was playing a
certain game for the fun of the thing&mdash;and I may
find it cheap now, when I am playing that game in
solid sober earnest. Now do you understand?"</p>

<p>Mr. Simon Quarle leaned forward, and peered
down at this new wonder. "You mean to tell me
that you are no longer the rich Mr. Byfield we used
to know? You mean to tell me that you have got
to set to work to earn your living?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;and with no particular qualifications for
doing it," said Gilbert. "I'm not afraid, because
I think that it's really the life for which I was fitted;
idleness never really suited me. It's too long a story
to tell, but my affairs got out of order during that
time I disappeared from the world; and when I came
back they went from bad to worse. I have nothing
save what I may earn&mdash;and I rather think I want
friends."</p>

<p>Mr. Simon Quarle stretched out a hand, and Byfield
grasped it quickly. After a moment of silence
the elder man asked&mdash;"And that is the only thing
that has brought you back to Arcadia Street&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"That&mdash;and the memory of the best woman I
ever met. I've had a long year to think about her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
since she ran away from me&mdash;to wonder about her.
I've looked back over it all&mdash;and I've seen what I
was, and what I did, and how I strove to make her
something that should please myself only. I wanted
a toy&mdash;someone to be good to, and help&mdash;someone
who would look up at me, and say how good I was,
and how kind I had been&mdash;and so forth. I didn't
understand her then; I didn't know the value of
what I was striving to bend or break in my own direction.
I don't know where she is&mdash;I don't hope ever
to have anything to do with her again; because if
I met her she must carry that resentment in her heart
for me always. But I'd give a good deal to call her
back here, if only for an hour&mdash;just to tell her
what I think about it all. I suppose you know nothing
about her?"</p>

<p>"Am I likely to know anything?" snapped the
other, in the old fashion. "I came back here because
I liked the place, and because she had lived here;
that's all. I can tell you about some of the others,
and about what's happened to them, if you like; I've
heard vague things from time to time."</p>

<p>"Do you think it likely that she has gone back
to her father?" asked Gilbert eagerly. "Because
if you know where he is I might be able&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Daniel Meggison has done rather well for
himself&mdash;and I don't think he wants anything to
do with his daughter," said Quarle, seating himself
and folding his arms. "It appears that he wandered
about a bit in Ireland, and finally drifted to Liverpool;
and there he took up his quarters in a little
public-house. The public-house was owned by a confiding
widow&mdash;and Daniel Meggison was ever plausible.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
He married the widow, and settled down in
some sort of comfort."</p>

<p>"Ungrateful brute!" exclaimed Gilbert. "And
the son?"</p>

<p>"Cast off by his father, and unable to find his
sister, he really did something for himself at last,
in his own particular fashion. I think he does a little
in the way of billiard-marking, and a little in the
way of racing, and more still in the way of borrowing.
He'll never starve, you may be sure of that.
The Stockers got back in due course to Clapham,
and have doubtless settled down into their own old
way of life; that exhausts my list."</p>

<p>"You will be interested to know, perhaps," said
Gilbert in his turn, "that Mr. Tant married Miss
Ewart-Crane some months ago; I've seen very little
of him, but I believe their extraordinary adventures
on a desert island are already quite the talk in their
own particular sphere. Pringle&mdash;most wonderful
of servants&mdash;is no longer a servant of mine, but
is, I believe, doing well for himself. When last I
saw him he had got in touch with the captain and
crew of the lost <i>Blue Bird</i>; they were all picked
up."</p>

<p>Simon Quarle got to his feet, and stood for a
moment thoughtfully scratching his chin. "I suppose,"
he said at last slowly, without looking at Byfield&mdash;"I
suppose that if the child ever came into
your life again you'd make the same muddles&mdash;and
do the same foolish things you did before&mdash;wouldn't
you? Don't frown; I'm an old man, and I was very
fond of the girl. I only ask because one likes to
know the point of view of other people. You're<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
never likely to see her again, you know&mdash;so that
you needn't answer if you don't want to."</p>

<p>"If I ever found her&mdash;and she ever forgave me&mdash;I
should tell her simply and truly what I told
her before&mdash;that I love her," said Gilbert. "If
she'd let me I'd work for her with a better heart than
I can ever work for myself only. Because I tell you,"
he finished simply&mdash;"there's no other woman like
her in all the world."</p>

<p>"Amen to that!" said Quarle, moving to the door.
"But you're a bit late; you're not likely to see her
again, you know."</p>

<p>Simon Quarle, with a final nod, went out of the
room, closing the door behind him. He went thoughtfully
down to his own quarters, and for a long time
paced about there, as though he had some problem
in his mind difficult of solution. More than once he
stopped in his restless walk, with his eyes upon the
ground; more than once he shook his head, as though
he felt that the way to solve the problem had not
been found yet. And at last sat down in his shabby
arm-chair, with his hands clasped on his knees, to
think it out afresh.</p>

<p>The lamplighter had drifted in from the bigger
world outside, and had lit the lamps in Arcadia
Street&mdash;performing that duty in a casual perfunctory
manner, as though it didn't matter very
much whether Arcadia Street was lighted or not.
The Arcadia Arms was doing a great trade, with its
doors swinging and banging every minute or two,
and the roar of the greater world outside Arcadia
Street had not yet finished for the day. Out from
that greater world there drifted into Arcadia Street<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
a little figure that came with lagging feet&mdash;a little
figure that had come into Arcadia Street many many
times through the years that had once, as it seemed,
been happily left behind. A shabbier figure even
than of old, although as neat as ever; a white-faced
girl, carrying bundles and parcels. She stopped at
the door of that house that had so recently swallowed
up a new lodger, and let herself in with a
key.</p>

<p>"Sich goin's on since you went out," said Mrs.
Laws, nodding her head solemnly at the girl. "Cabs
arrivin'&mdash;an' things bein' took upstairs&mdash;bags an'
boxes, an' bundles an' things; an' as nice a young
man as ever I set my two eyes on&mdash;though shy.
An' goodness knows in these 'ard times a extra lodger
is a puffeck gift of Providence."</p>

<p>"I hope he won't be unreasonable," said the girl,
with a little sigh. "Some of them have such a way
of ringing bells for no particular reason&mdash;and one
gets so tired sometimes. But I'm glad&mdash;for your
sake, Mrs. Laws."</p>

<p>Simon Quarle had been on the look out; he bent
over the stair head, and called in a hoarse whisper&mdash;</p>

<p>"Bessie!&mdash;Bessie!"</p>

<p>She looked up at him with a smile, and climbed
the stairs; she thought, as she looked at him, that
he seemed strangely excited. He held her hand for
a moment as they stood together on the landing, and
he patted it softly, and seemed almost (although
that, of course, was absurd) to be chuckling. He
drew her into his room, and closed the door.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;what's the matter, Mr. Quarle?" asked
the girl.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<hr class="chap" />

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>"Bessie Meggison&mdash;have you heard about the
new lodger?" asked Simon Quarle, holding her hand
and speaking very solemnly.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;of course I've heard about him," replied
Bessie wonderingly. "Mrs. Laws told me. What
does it matter?&mdash;to me it only means so many more
stairs to climb so many times a day. You forget that
I'm nothing more than a servant here."</p>

<p>"I try not to remember it," said Simon Quarle,
gently touching her cheek with one hand with a touch
as light as that of a woman. "When you came back
here, little woman&mdash;hoping to get shelter in the old
Arcadia Street on which you had so gladly turned
your back once upon a time&mdash;you found me&mdash;didn't
you?"</p>

<p>She nodded quickly. "And you made it all right
with Mrs. Laws, so that I might have food and shelter
and a very little money in return for my work.
Why&mdash;I might have starved but for you."</p>

<p>"Not quite so bad as that, perhaps&mdash;but still,
you were pretty low down," said the man. "The
world hasn't treated you well, my dear&mdash;but then
the world never does treat the timid ones well. You
didn't fight hard enough; you hadn't cheek enough.
Only I want you to understand, Bessie dear, that
you're not the only one that has suffered."</p>

<p>"I know that," she said quickly. "Poor father
went through a lot of privations before he found
someone to take pity on him; and dear Aubrey must
find it hard sometimes to make a living."</p>

<p>"I wasn't thinking about poor father or dear
Aubrey," exclaimed Quarle snappishly. "They'll
get on all right for themselves. But there is someone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
else, my child&mdash;someone perhaps we have not
quite understood."</p>

<p>She tried to withdraw her hand, but he held it
firmly, and patted it as he went on speaking.</p>

<p>"I know, my dear&mdash;I know all about it, and I
know what you feel," said Simon Quarle. "Only in
this poor strange topsy-turvy world of ours we are
all a little like children&mdash;wilful and headstrong,
and always so sure that we know what is best for us.
And the great god Chance happens along one day,
and sees that we are in a bit of a muddle, and are
spoiling our lives; and shakes us up, and tumbles us
about&mdash;and perhaps sets us straight again. This
one has a gilded toy, and doesn't know how much it's
worth; and so the toy is snatched away and given
to another; and this one has nothing, and gets perhaps
not the gift it craved, but something better yet.
What if I told you, Bessie, that the man who played
that great game of make-believe with you had
touched disaster too, and was as poor as you are?"</p>

<p>"You have heard from him?" she asked quickly.</p>

<p>He nodded slowly. "I have heard from him&mdash;and
he has been through rather a bad time. The
game of make-believe for him is ended; he has come
down to the realities. All his money is gone; he's
got to work and fight and strive, as every other
man must work and fight and strive in this world, if
he's to be worthy to be called a man at all. And
he wanted to know about you, Bessie."</p>

<p>"Only the old whim&mdash;only the old feeling that
he's sorry for me. I'm only a little patient drudge
again, in the house where he first saw me; and even
the poor old garden that I think he laughed at secretly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
to himself is gone, and blotted out. You
mustn't tell him where I am; I don't want him to
know."</p>

<p>"Did you love him, Bess?" Simon Quarle stood
squarely before her, with his hands clasped behind
his back.</p>

<p>She hesitated for a moment, and then looked up
at him, with a little touch of colour stealing over
her white face, and with a smile in her eyes. "Yes,"
she said slowly&mdash;"I loved him very dearly. If he
blundered, he blundered rather finely; and I shall
always think of him as I knew him first&mdash;someone
frank and friendly, coming out of the great world,
and liking me a little because I liked him. There&mdash;there&mdash;don't
talk about it; he has his own friends,
I suppose, even in his poverty. You said he was
poor&mdash;didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;very poor. Poor enough, I should think,
to live in Arcadia Street in real earnest," said Simon.
"Well&mdash;I'm sorry if I've touched on anything that
has pained you; best forget it. Love's a queer
business, and I'm not sure that you're not well out
of it. Let the brute starve; it'll do him good."</p>

<p>"Mr. Quarle&mdash;you know I didn't mean that at
all," faltered Bessie. "You're the unkindest man
I've ever met."</p>

<p>"Sorry you think so," said Quarle, turning upon
her frowningly. "But you needn't stop and bully
me; if you remembered your duties properly you'd
know that this new lodger by this time probably requires
some attention. Go away and look after him;
personally, I'm disappointed in you."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, you're not," she coaxed, putting her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
arms about his neck. "You always growl at me, I
think, when you love me the most."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I do," he snapped, thrusting her away
from him. "But go and attend to the new lodger."</p>

<p>She climbed the stairs wearily, thinking a little of
what Simon Quarle had said&mdash;wondering why it
happened that life must be always a grey and profitless
thing to some, and not to others. She knocked
softly at the door, and heard a shout from within,
commanding her to enter; caught her breath for a
moment, and passed her hand across her eyes, as
though she felt that she might still be dreaming.
Then, as the shout was renewed, she opened the door,
and went slowly in.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The stars had come out even over Arcadia Street,
to help the lamps a little; and still the two sat at
the window of that room, looking out into an Arcadia
Street that was strangely beautified. So much there
was for them to say to each other&mdash;so much that
had never been said before by any man or woman in
all the great world&mdash;or so at least they thought.
Only once, smiling through her tears, Bessie drew
away from him, and looked at him for a moment
with the old perplexed frown.</p>

<p>"If you should be cheating me again!" she whispered.
"If, instead of this poor room for your
home, you should really be rich, and should be trying
to steal me out of my poverty by a trick! For the
love of God, don't do that again; be fair to me&mdash;be
just to me!"</p>

<p>"My darling, that particular game of make-believe
ended a long time ago," he said&mdash;"but a new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
one begins from to-night. We shall have to work
hard, you and I, to keep the wolf from the door;
and we shall have to make-believe hard to show that
we like it."</p>

<p>"That won't be any make-believe for me, dear,"
she whispered.</p>

<p>Simon Quarle took it into his head to climb the
stairs presently, and after knocking softly in vain,
to look in and see them. They came forward a little
guiltily, hand in hand, to bear his scrutiny; he shook
his head over them whimsically enough.</p>

<p>"Well," he growled to Gilbert&mdash;"does she believe
you now?"</p>

<p>"I think so," said Gilbert softly.</p>

<p>"Little fool!" said Simon Quarle, touching the
girl's cheek with rough tenderness. He turned on
his heel and walked out of the room; and his eyes
were shining.</p>

as novelist has yet conceived, and one that arrests the
mind by its fine strenuousness of purpose.</p>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
